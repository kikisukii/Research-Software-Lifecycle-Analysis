FHIR-to-CAPACITY provides a piece of the puzzle for hospitals to automate the process  The FAIR data for CAPACITY project aims to automate the process of uploading data on COVID-19 patients to the central [CAPACITY registry](https://capacity-covid.eu/). However, the data models for electronic health records vary a lot per hospital.  In the FAIR data for CAPACITY project we aim to generalize the process as much as possible by requiring that the hospital data should be converted to the FHIR format first. After this conversion, which has to be customized per hospital, the final conversion can be picked up by FHIR to CAPACITY. This software will convert the FHIR data into records that are compliant with the [CAPACITY codebook](http://capacity-covid.eu/wp-content/uploads/CAPACITY-REDCap-2.pdf) and will upload it to the REDCap registry that has been provided by the user.",https://github.com/FAIR-data-for-CAPACITY/FHIR-to-CAPACITY,FAIR-data-for-CAPACITY/FHIR-to-CAPACITY

01a3e457-1d77-432f-a8e5-55fb7985b78f,4tu-dataset-nondimensionalisationqmom,Dataset-NonDimensionalisationQMOM,"Wet granulation is a multiphase process utilised to produce aggregate particles with defined properties from very fine powders. Simulating this process on the microscale is challenging because of the large number of particles involved, which differ widely in both size and material properties. Macroscale methods, which track only the particle bulk properties, are efficient but do not resolve disperse particle properties such as the particle size distribution (PSD), which is key information for downstream processing. These deficiencies are addressed by mesoscale methods like population balance (PB) models, which track distributed properties such as the particle size by adding them as internal variables to the macroscale (CFD) model. However, most mesoscale methods are either inaccurate (method of moments when cutting off moments) or computationally expensive (Monte Carlo, class methods). Recently a new closure for the method of moments, the quadrature method of moments (QMOM), was introduced to allow accurate moment tracking of a PSD with low computational effort. One disadvantage of this method is that it can suffer from instabilities. These, however, can be overcome by non-dimensionalization. In the study we show our insights gained by non-dimensionalizing the QMOM equations for wet granulation processes, which model the PSD via growth, aggregation and breakage kernels. Also relevant numerical and theoretical issues as well as limitations are discussed.  The software in this dataset can be used to reproduce all figures and verify the integrity of the title paper. The software consists of a fully working MATLAB (Version R2019b) script for a non-dimensional and dimensional quadrature method of moments and all the additional methods that are needed to run the quadrature method of moments (reading in data, adaptive Wheeler algorithm, etc.).

03ae5e6f-8844-439a-b340-39ca1990d7f6,trap-the-lofar-transients-pipeline,TraP: The LOFAR Transients Pipeline ,"The LOFAR Transients Pipeline (“TraP”) provides a means of searching a stream of N-dimensional (two spatial, frequency, polarization) image “cubes” for transient astronomical sources. The pipeline was developed specifically to address data produced by the LOFAR Transients Key Science Project, but is also applicable to a range of other instruments.  The TraP codebase provides the pipeline definition itself, as well as a number of supporting routines for source finding, measurement, characterization, and so on. Some of these routines are also available as stand-alone tools.  ### Key features  * Customisable ‘quality-control’ steps to weed out bad images before processing. * Built-in sourcefinder optimized for radio-synthesis images. * Optional source-fitting constraints (only fit point-sources, avoid fitting sources near to edge of image, etc). * Source-association incorporates knowledge of positional errors (using the DeRuiter radius algorithm) - this means much less trial-and-error tweaking of source-association parameters when working with a new dataset. * ‘Skyregion’ tracking - this keeps a record of which parts of sky have been previously surveyed, and to what faint limit, allowing for better separation of real transients and marginal steady-source detections. * Variability metrics and cataloguing for every source - no need to choose transient-detection thresholds ahead of time, simply sort through the data after processing and judge for yourself. * Position monitoring and null-detection tracking. ‘Forced’ source-fits are attempted at positions where a source has been previously detected, or where a monitoring location has been manually specified, allowing for better detection of sources near to the faint limit. * All source measurements are stored in a standard SQL database; users can write their own custom data-extraction and analysis tools if desired. * Ready-made web-based data-exploration interface. TraP is accompanied by Banana, a web-based tool which allows astronomers to sort and search source-catalogues without requiring any local installation or programming. Provides interactive plots, links to external catalogue searches, and more. * Support for multiple data formats and telescopes. TraP can process both FITS and CASA MeasurementSet formats, and it is usually quite straightforward to add support for a new telescope.

042b4edb-4aa3-4297-b1ed-2c8090a34335,parcels,Parcels,"Parcels (which is a ‘backronym’ for “Probably A Really Computationally Efficient Lagrangian Simulator”) is a set of Python classes and methods to create customisable particle tracking simulations using output from Ocean Circulation models. Parcels can be used to track passive water parcels in what is often referred to as Lagrangian Ocean Analysis ([Van Sebille _et al_ 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2017.11.008)), as well as active particulates such as plastic and fish.  Parcels has been used in more than 80 peer-reviewed articles. It has been used in applications as diverse as global oceanic transport of microplastic particles (e.g., [Wichmann _et al_ 2019](https://doi.org/10.1088/2515-7620/ab4e77)), planning of routes of Underwater Autonomous Vehicles ([Boulares and Barnawi 2021](https://doi.org/10.3389/frobt.2022.958930)), mapping of the genetic connectivity and of fish ([Sefc _et al_ 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbi.13946), [Schilling _et al_ 2020](https://doi.org/10.1111/fog.12473), [Lindo‐Atichati _et al_ 2020](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JC015348)) and assessment of the role of swimming in turtle hatchling survival ([Le Gouvello _et al_ 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2020.109130)).   Parcels supports a multitude of Ocean General Circulation Model outputs, including from NEMO, MITgcm, HYCOM, POP, MOM and ROMS/CROCO. In general, it supports any vertical grid and (curvi)linear grid with the only limitation that it does not yet support unstructured meshes.  The unique feature of Parcels, compared to other community codes such as Ariane ([Blanke and Raynaud 1997](https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0485(1997)027%3C1038:KOTPEU%3E2.0.CO;2)), TRACMASS ([Döös _et al_ 2017](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-10-1733-2017)), OpenDrift ([Dagestad _et al_ 2018](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-1405-2018)), CMS ([Paris _et al_ 2013](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2012.12.006)), LADIM ([Ådlandsvik and Sundby 1994](https://www.ices.dk/sites/pub/Publication%20Reports/Marine%20Science%20Symposia/ICES%20Marine%20Science%20Symposia%20-%20Volume%20198%20-%201994%20-%20Part%2033%20of%2063.pdf)) or TrackMPD ([Jalón-Rojas _et al_ 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2019.02.052)), is that in Parcels it is extremely simple to encode the ‘behavior’ of particles.   Using what are called ‘kernels’ in Parcels, users can write simple functions that act on the virtual particles and make them e.g., sink, beach, fragment or die. These actions can depend on the local conditions – such as sea water temperature, current speed or any other field that comes out of an Ocean General Circulation Model – as well as on properties of the particles themselves such as their age, density, or size. These kernels can then be combined with each other and with pre-loaded kernels such as for advection and diffusion. This kernel-driven computation makes Parcels highly versatile and adaptable to different types of virtual particles, including plastic and plankton as well as turtles and tuna ([Scutt Phillips _et al_ 2016](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2018.04.007)).",https://github.com/OceanParcels/parcels,OceanParcels/parcels

04e8f730-ea9f-4b24-885c-f3cf824ff3e6,4tu-heast,HEAST,"The Hybrid Electric Aircraft Sizing Tool (HEAST) was developed at Delft University of Technology and is intended for the conceptual design of aircraft with (hybrid-) electric propulsion systems. These drivetrains open the space to new propulsor layouts commonly know as ""distributed propulsion"", where the aerodynamic interaction between propulsors and airframe can be significant. More specifically, the tool focuses on the preliminary sizing part of the conceptual design phase, where the designer translates the top-level aircraft requirements and design choices into a first layout and estimate of weights, wing area, and installed power. The tool is therefore a sizing tool and *not* an analysis tool: it cannot assess the performance of a predefined geometry/weight/etc.     The tool is implemented in MATLAB and is versatile because it allows the user to size aircraft with a wide array of powertrain types (conventional, serial, parallel, electric, turboelectric,...), propulsor layouts (leading-edge propellers, over-the-wing propellers,...), and can easily be adapted to account for different performance requirements. However, it requires a significant amount of input parameters and contains numerous (sub-) functions with many if-checks and iteration loops. It is therefore only recommended for users who have a detailed understanding of aircraft conceptual design *and* are versatile in the MATLAB language.",https://data.4tu.nl/v3/datasets/61cbe615-b7a8-4fa5-893b-9871f73e163f.git,

Please note this library finds only high confidence drugs and doesn't support misspellings at present.  It also only finds the English names of these drugs. Names in other languages are not supported.  It also doesn't find short code names of drugs, such as abbreviations commonly used in medicine, such as ""Ceph"" for ""Cephradin"" - as these are highly ambiguous.  # 💻Installing drug named entity recognition Python package  You can install from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/drug-named-entity-recognition).  ``` pip install drug-named-entity-recognition ```  If you get an error installing, try making a new Python environment in Conda (`conda create -n test-env; conda activate test-env`) or Venv (`python -m testenv; source testenv/bin/activate` / `testenv\Scripts\activate`) and then installing the library.  The library already contains the drug names so if you don't need to update the dictionary, then you should not have to run any of the download scripts.  If you have problems installing, try our [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/fastdatascience/drug_named_entity_recognition/blob/main/drug_named_entity_recognition_example_walkthrough.ipynb) walkthrough.  # 💡Usage examples  You must first tokenise your input text using a tokeniser of your choice (NLTK, spaCy, etc).  You pass a list of strings to the `find_drugs` function.  Example 1  ``` from drug_named_entity_recognition import find_drugs  find_drugs(""i bought some Prednisone"".split("" "")) ```  outputs a list of tuples.  ``` [({'name': 'Prednisone', 'synonyms': {'Sone', 'Sterapred', 'Deltasone', 'Panafcort', 'Prednidib', 'Cortan', 'Rectodelt', 'Prednisone', 'Cutason', 'Meticorten', 'Panasol', 'Enkortolon', 'Ultracorten', 'Decortin', 'Orasone', 'Winpred', 'Dehydrocortisone', 'Dacortin', 'Cortancyl', 'Encorton', 'Encortone', 'Decortisyl', 'Kortancyl', 'Pronisone', 'Prednisona', 'Predniment', 'Prednisonum', 'Rayos'}, 'medline_plus_id': 'a601102', 'mesh_id': 'D018931', 'drugbank_id': 'DB00635'}, 3, 3)] ```  You can ignore case with:  ``` find_drugs(""i bought some prednisone"".split("" ""), is_ignore_case=True) ```",https://github.com/fastdatascience/drug_named_entity_recognition,fastdatascience/drug_named_entity_recognition

This will only work if the coarse method is good enough so that we can initiate multiple fine integrations from a coarsely estimated intermediate condition.  This Python module implements Parareal as a so-called black-box method. This means that the algorithm doesn't need to know about the details of the simulation.

Microwave radiance observations from satellites are one of the main contributors to its forecast skill, but these observations contain biases that need to be corrected. Currently, in HARMONIE-AROME, bias correction is performed using a Variational Bias Correction method (VarBC), which consists of linear models including different bias predictors alongside their bias coefficients. However, this method is computationally intensive. This study investigates the potential of machine learning models to emulate the VarBC method by predicting the bias coefficients of its linear equations, offering a more computationally efficient alternative. This research uses data corresponding to the microwave radiance observations from the instruments AMSU-A, MHS and MWHS2. The machine learning models were trained on data from the DINI domain and subsequently tested on a new domain. The findings reveal that the machine learning models successfully emulate VarBC on a new, unseen domain and that they can be trained within seconds/minutes. Moreover, the predictions generated by these models are immediately usable without requiring a spin-up phase. The study further reveals that including bias predictors additional to those preselected by HARMONIE-AROME does not enhance the prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the research suggests that data from some instruments are helpful in predicting bias coefficients from other instruments.&nbsp;",https://data.4tu.nl/v3/datasets/30fe17c5-c43d-4833-a464-33029b779ccc.git,

0d3b06a1-369d-403f-8464-275a2f22a787,nedextract,nedextract,"## Nedextract nedextract is developed to extract specific information from annual report PDF files that are written in Dutch. Currently it tries to do the following:  - Read the PDF file, and perform Named Entity Recognition (NER) using Stanza to extract all persons and all organisations named in the document, which are then processed by the processes listed below. - Extract persons: using a rule-based method that searches for specific keywords, this module tries to identify:     - Ambassadors     - People in important positions in the organisation. The code tries to determine a main job description (e.g. director or board) and a sub-job description (e.g. chairman or treasurer). Note that these positions are identified and outputted in Dutch.       The main jobs that are considered are:          - directeur         - raad van toezicht         - bestuur         - ledenraad         - kascommissie         - controlecommisie          The sub positions that are considered are:         - directeur         - voorzitter         - vicevoorzitter         - lid         - penningmeester         - commissaris         - adviseur          For each person that is identified, the code searches for keywords in the sentences in which the name appears to determine the main position, or the sentence directly before or after that. Subjobs are determine based on words appearing directly before or after the name of a person for whom a main job has been determined. For the main jobs and sub positions, various ways of writing are considered in the keywords. Also before the search for the job-identification starts, name-deduplication is performed by creating lists of names that (likely) refer to one and the same person (e.g. Jane Doe and J. Doe).  - Extract related organisations:     - After Stanza NER collects all candidates for mentioned organisations, postprocessing tasks try to determine which of these candidates are most likely true candidates. This is done by considering: how often the terms is mentioned in the document, how often the term was identified as an organisation by Stanza NER, whether the term contains keywords that make it likely to be a true positive, and whether the term contains keywords that make it likely to be a false positive. For candidates that are mentioned only once in the text, it is also considered whether the term by itself (i.e. without context) is identified as an organisation by Stanza NER. Additionally, for candidates that are mentioned only once, an extra check is performed to determine whether part of the candidate org is found to be a in the list of orgs that are already identified as true, and whether that true org is common within the text. In that case the candidate is found to be 'already part of another true org', and not added to the true orgs. This is done, because sometimes an additional random word is identified by NER as being part of an organisation's name.      - For those terms that are identified as true organisations, the number of occurrences in the document of each of them (in it's entirety, enclosed by word boudaries) is determined.     - Finally, the identified organisations are attempted to be matched on a list of provided organisations using the `anbis` argument, to collect their rsin number for further analysis. An empty file `./Data/Anbis_clean.csv` is availble that serves as template for such a file. Matching is attempted both on currentStatutoryName and shortBusinessName. Only full matches (independent of capitals) and full matches with the additional term 'Stichting' at the start of the identified organisation (again independent of capitals) are considered for matching. Fuzzy matching is not used here, because during testing, this was found to lead to a significant amount of false positives.   - Classify the sector in which the organisation is active. The code uses a pre-trained model to identify one of eight sectors in which the organisation is active. The model is trained on the 2020 annual report pdf files of CBF certified organisations.",https://github.com/Transparency-in-the-non-profit-sector/nedextract,Transparency-in-the-non-profit-sector/nedextract

The blocks can also be integrated into a single pipeline to extract the features from all modalities at once. Next to extracting features, mexca can also identify the speakers shown in the video by clustering speaker and face representations. This allows users to compare emotion expressions across speakers, time, and contexts.  The package contains five components that can be used to build the MEXCA pipeline:  - FaceExtractor: Detects faces, encodes them into an embedding space, clusters the embeddings to link reoccuring faces, and extracts facial landmarks and action units. - SpeakerIdentifier: Performs speaker diarization, that is, detects speech and speech segments, encodes speakers into an embedding space, and clusters the embeddings. Attempts to answer the question: “Who speaks when?”. - VoiceExtractor: Extracts voice features, such as pitch, associated with emotion expressions. - AudioTranscriber: Transcribes detected speech segments to text. - SentimentExtractor: Predicts sentiment scores for the transcribed text.",https://github.com/mexca/mexca,mexca/mexca

It combines semi-supervised topic modeling to identify and select politically-motivated letters with path-based temporal social networks to trace how political discourse spread between influential figures, accounting for the timing and flow of communication.  By focusing on correspondence data such as Founders Online and the Letters of Delegates to Congress, H-GEAR enables to map out networks of communication, pinpointing how and where political ideas were propagated. The network analysis helps identify the key actors who shaped these ideological shifts and tracks the spread of these ideas over time.  The software provides a robust framework for researchers to examine the interplay between language and social networks, offering a nuanced understanding of how political concepts were transmitted and transformed during the American Revolution.

Packages such `GridapDistributed` have shown weak and strong scaling up to tens of thousands of CPU cores in the distributed assembly of sparse linear systems when using `PartitionedArrays` as their distributed linear algebra back-end.  # Why  The main objective of this package is to avoid to interface directly with MPI or MPI-based libraries when prototyping and debugging distributed parallel codes. MPI-based applications are executed in batch mode with commands like `mpiexec -np 4 julia input.jl`, which break the Julia development workflow. In particular, one starts a fresh Julia session at each run, making difficult to reuse compiled code between runs. In addition, packages like `Revise` and `Debugger` are also difficult to use in combination with MPI computations on several processes.  To overcome these limitations, `PartitionedArrays` considers a data-oriented programming model that allows one to write distributed algorithms in a generic way, independent from the message passing back-end used to run them. MPI is one of the possible back-ends available in `PartitionedArrays`, used to deploy large computations on computational clusters. However, one can also use other back-ends that are able to run on standard serial Julia sessions, which allows one to use the standard Julia workflow to develop and debug complex codes in an effective way.",https://github.com/PartitionedArrays/PartitionedArrays.jl,PartitionedArrays/PartitionedArrays.jl
13108811-a425-4b7b-9941-b9baa1e3d7b8,rickview,RickView,"# Summary Search, browsing and exploration is a critical area in the linked data (LD) lifecycle. Similar to web browsers, where users enter the URL of a website and receive a display of an HTML document, in linked data browsers, users enter the URL of an RDF resource and receive a human readable representation. However in contrast to websites, RDF resources are intended to be processed by machines and do not provide a standardized way of being displayed.  An RDF graph, also called a knowledge base, is a set of RDF triples in the form of (subject, predicate, object) and typically describes a common domain under a shared namespace, which can be abbreviated with a prefix, such as `rdf`. For example, the RDF vocabulary has a ""hash namespace"" (ending with a `#` character) of `http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#`, which signifies that all resources, like `rdf:type` and `rdf:property`, of the vocabulary are described in the same document, which is suitable for small graphs such as ontologies that are not intended to be viewed by non-expert users.  RDF browsers on the other hand *resolve URIs* (URLs) of knowledge bases with ""slash namespaces"" (ending with a '/' character), so that each resource has it's associated page. Ideally, they offer a machine processable RDF serialization as well, based on either content negotation, POST parameters or URL variants such as `http://mynamespace/myresource.ttl`. LD browsers describe the direct neighbourhood of a resource in an RDF graph, that is they list all triples where the given resource is either the subject (a direct connection) or the object (an inverse connection).  We present RickView, an RDF browser with the following design goals:  * performance: low memory and CPU utilization, fast page load times and high number of handled requests * robustness: once it compiles, it runs indefinitely * standalone: no dependance on services such as a SPARQL endpoint or a web server * adaptability to any small to medium sized knowledge base via sensible defaults that can be changed in a configuration file and overridden with environment variables * containerization: offer a compact container image containing a statically linked binary * simplicity: RickView is minimalistic and only offers browsing of static data  Non goals: RickView is a read-only visualization for static data, does not offer other visualization types, such as graph based, and is not a search engine. It is not designed for data that does not fit on one machine (""big data"") or indeed data that does not fit on RAM. Large knowledge bases, such as the complete DBpedia, fit better with the traditional SPARQL endpoint paradigm.  # Statement of need  While initial enthusiasm in the Semantic Web field has led to a large amount of published knowledge bases, mainstream adoption has stagnated due to a lack of freely available performant, accessible, robust and adaptable tools.  Instead, limited duration research grants motivate the proliferation of countless research prototypes, which are not optimized for any of those criteria, are not maintained after the project ends and compete for resources on crowded servers if they do not break down completely. While there are are several existing RDF browsers, they are not optimized for performance.  # Implementation   The standard backend for LD projects are *SPARQL endpoints*, which allow expressive SQL-like *SPARQL queries*, however they are overengineered for the simple task of browsing. For example, the popular Virtuoso Open-Source Edition maps SPARQL to SQL queries on top of a relational database, which is faster than native triplestores like Apache Jena but requires tuning of parameters like memory buffer sizes for optimal resource allocation and the RDF data model can cause large amounts of joins, which negatively impacts query runtime.  RickView instead follows an alternative approach of directly querying an in-memory dataset bypassing SPARQL. RickView is an LD browser written in Rust, which enables a high level of performance comparable to C and C++ while being memory-safe and thread-safe by design.  In order to keep the focus on performance and to get a baseline of functionality for performance evaluation, the web page layout is in large parts copied over from LodView.",https://github.com/KonradHoeffner/rickview,KonradHoeffner/rickview

In this study, co-authors and I aimed to comprehend the genetic and physiological underpinnings of photosynthetic light-use efficiency (LUE) under high irradiance conditions, focusing on the plant species Hirschfeldia incana. We performed a comparison of the transcriptional signature associated to very high, ""supernatural"" irradiance in H. incana with three other Brassicaceae plants (Arabidopsis thaliana, Brassica rapa, and Brassica nigra), which previously demonstrated lower photosynthetic LUE. By utilizing a panproteome, we assessed gene expression patterns in response to high irradiance across the four species. Our findings reveal that all species actively regulate genes linked to photosynthesis. Analyzing genes associated with three key photosynthetic pathways, we observed a consistent pattern of reduced gene expression under high irradiance conditions. Notably, specific genes exhibited differential expression exclusively in H. incana, while in other instances, transcript abundance was consistently higher in H. incana regardless of light intensity. In conclusion, the study this software supports presents the first comparative transcriptome analysis of plant species grown entirely under prolonged high irradiance, rather than just briefly exposed to it. We demonstrate that, in contrast to other Brassicaceae species, H. incana subjected to intense irradiance displays enhanced gene expression related to photosynthesis through distinct mechanisms: canonical differential expression, inherent elevated expression of single-copy genes, and cumulative elevated expression via simultaneous expression of multiple gene copies. This research establishes a crucial groundwork for future endeavors aimed at comprehending elevated photosynthetic light-use efficiency and ultimately achieving highly effective photosynthesis in agricultural crops.",https://data.4tu.nl/v3/datasets/1688428e-78c1-4412-9b9f-c050f09dc2c7.git,

The related article presents a novel pesticide transport model extension for the OpenLISEM runoff and erosion model. During water erosion events, high amounts of pesticides can be transported alongside the runoff. Simulating this process helps to mitigate adverse effects of pesticides in the environment. We conceptualized pesticide uptake during runoff with a mixing-layer, including mass transfer of dissolved pesticides into the runoff water and detachment in combination with enrichment of sorbed pesticides. Lateral transport of pesticides is modelled with a kinematic wave based on the overland flow of water. The model simulations were in line with observations for two events in a small agricultural catchment in South-Limburg, the Netherlands. A sensitivity analysis showed that pesticide transport was mainly influenced by the mass transfer rate, the soil-water partitioning and the exponent for the enrichment ratio. The accurate simulation of runoff and erosion by OpenLISEM, enables OLP to simulate transport and redistribution adequately.",https://data.4tu.nl/v3/datasets/844929e6-2c90-458f-980f-a7089a063486.git,

To do so, they need to include code to interact with the scheduling systems and file transfer protocols used on those remote machines.  Unfortunately, many different scheduler systems and file transfer protocols exist, often with completely different programming interfaces. This makes it difficult for applications to switch to a different system or support multiple remote systems simultaneously.  Xenon solves this problem by providing a single programming interface to many different types of remote resources. As a result, changing from one scheduler to another, or from one file transfer protocol to another, becomes a matter of changing just a few lines of code. This is obviously much cheaper in time and money than developing, debugging, and maintaining new code that implements the same logic you had before, but for a different scheduler or a different file transfer protocol.",https://github.com/xenon-middleware/xenon,xenon-middleware/xenon
1b865c42-0505-43f6-9a33-d5b6eca4abe6,covid-19-integrated-surveillance-data-in-italy,COVID-19 Integrated Surveillance Data in Italy,"## Overview   Every week the National Institute for Nuclear Physics ([INFN](https://home.infn.it/it/)) imports an anonymous individual-level dataset from the Italian National Institute of Health ([ISS](https://www.iss.it)) and converts it into an incidence time series data organized by date of event and disaggregated by sex, age and administrative level with a consolidation period of approximately two weeks. The information available to the [INFN](https://home.infn.it/it/) is summarised in the following [meta-table](https://covid19.infn.it/iss/campi-iss.pdf).  ## Data   ### Archive  The original [data](https://covid19.infn.it/iss/) has been stored [here](https://github.com/InPhyT/COVID19-Italy-Integrated-Surveillance-Data/tree/main/0_archive), reorganised [here](https://github.com/InPhyT/COVID19-Italy-Integrated-Surveillance-Data/tree/main/1_structured_archive).   ### Input   The input data has been stored [here](https://github.com/InPhyT/COVID19-Italy-Integrated-Surveillance-Data/tree/main/2_input) and contain the following information: - Aggregated data in the [`daily_incidences_by_region`](https://github.com/InPhyT/COVID19-Italy-Integrated-Surveillance-Data/tree/main/2_input/daily_incidences_by_region) folder:   * Weekly moving average and daily time series of **confirmed cases by date of diagnosis** at the regional level;   * Weekly moving average and daily time series of **ordinary hospital admissions by date of admission** at the regional level;   * Weekly moving average and daily time series of **intensive hospital admissions by date of admission** at regional level;   * Weekly moving average and daily time series of **deceased cases by date of death** at the regional level. - Disaggregated data in the [`daily_incidences_by_region_sex_age`](https://github.com/InPhyT/COVID19-Italy-Integrated-Surveillance-Data/tree/main/2_input/daily_incidences_by_region_sex_age) folder:   - Weekly moving average time series of **symptomatic cases by date of symptoms onset** stratified by sex and age at the regional level;   - Weekly moving average time series of **confirmed cases by date of diagnosis** stratified by sex and age at the regional level;   - Weekly moving average time series of **ordinary hospital admissions by date of admission** stratified by sex and age at the regional level;   - Weekly moving average time series of **intensive hospital admissions by date of admission** stratified by sex and age at the regional level;   - Weekly moving average time series of **deceased cases by date of death** stratified by sex and age at the regional level.     ### Output   The output data has been stored [here](https://github.com/InPhyT/COVID19-Italy-Integrated-Surveillance-Data/tree/main/3_output/data) and contain the following information:  * Reconstructed daily time series of **confirmed cases by date of diagnosis** stratified by sex and age at the regional level; * Reconstructed daily time series of **symptomatic cases by date of symptoms onset** stratified by sex and age at the regional level; * Reconstructed daily time series of **ordinary hospital admissions** by date of admission stratified by sex and age at the regional level; * Reconstructed daily time series of **intensive hospital admissions** by date of admission stratified by sex and age at the regional level; * Reconstructed daily time series of **deceased cases by date of death** stratified by sex and age at the regional level.  ## Methodology   ### Data Organization  Raw data are downloaded from the [INFN](https://covid19.infn.it/iss/) (direct download [here](https://covid19.infn.it/iss/csv_part/iss.tar.gz)), decompressed, stored in the [`0_archive`](https://github.com/InPhyT/COVID19-Italy-Integrated-Surveillance-Data/tree/main/0_archive) folder and then organized into the  [`1_structured_archive`](https://github.com/InPhyT/COVID19-Italy-Integrated-Surveillance-Data/tree/main/1_structured_archive) folder via the execution of the [data_organization.jl](https://github.com/InPhyT/COVID19-Italy-Integrated-Surveillance-Data/blob/main/src/data_organization.jl) script.   ### Data Processing   In general, given the moving average (or rolling mean) of a time series, it's not possible to recover the original series unless *n* original points are known where *n* is the width of the window adopted in the moving average, but since epidemiological surveillance incidence series are strictly composed of natural numbers, we can leverage this property to come up with a finite number of candidate original series, and then prune these down to as little as possible, hopefully only one, final recovered series.  The whole procedure is performed via the execution of the [main.jl](https://github.com/InPhyT/COVID19-Italy-Integrated-Surveillance-Data/blob/main/src/main.jl) script and the related technical details can be found the documentation of [UnrollingAverages.jl](https://github.com/InPhyT/UnrollingAverages.jl) package.   The averaged time series to be **unrolled** (i.e. recovered, reconstructed or de-averaged) are those stored in the [`2_input/daily_incidences_by_region_sex_age`](https://github.com/COVID19-Italy-Integrated-Surveillance-Data/tree/main/2_input/daily_incidences_by_region_sex_age) folder: they are organized in .csv files, each of which reporting the 10 age-specific time series of a particular incidence in a particular region. Each dataset has two counterparts that are further stratified by sex.  Since the smaller the numbers involved the better UnrollingAverages.jl seems to perform, we opted for unrolling the sex-stratified series first and then aggregate them later. Since not all the age and sex stratified averaged series allows UnrollingAverages.jl to find an unique original series and no further sex-stratified information is provided by INFN, we attempted to directly unroll the sex-aggregated time series for which CovidStat provides additional information in the form of age-aggregated original time series, that we employed to select that combination of age-disaggregated series proposed by UnrollingAverages.jl which summed to the age-aggregated original time series provided by INFN. The utilized age and sex-aggregated may be found in the [`2_input/daily_incidences_by_region`](https://github.com/InPhyT/COVID19-Italy-Integrated-Surveillance-Data/tree/main/2_input/daily_incidences_by_region) folder. We'll refer to the last selection algorithm as the **cross-sectional consistency constraint**.   The successfully reconstructed time series are then saved in the [`3_output/data`](https://github.com/InPhyT/COVID19-Italy-Integrated-Surveillance-Data/tree/main/3_output/data) folder (both aggregated and disaggregated by sex), while the visualisations of those that are age-stratified and sex-aggregated may be found in [`3_output/figures`](https://github.com/InPhyT/COVID19-Italy-Integrated-Surveillance-Data/tree/main/3_output/figures).  ## How to Cite   If you use these data in your work, please cite this repository using the metadata in [`CITATION.bib`](https://github.com/InPhyT/COVID19-Italy-Integrated-Surveillance-Data/blob/main/CITATION.bib).",https://github.com/InPhyT/COVID19-Italy-Integrated-Surveillance-Data,InPhyT/COVID19-Italy-Integrated-Surveillance-Data

2156c668-c641-44f4-a3a1-c36f54c12eb1,cudawrappers,cudawrappers,"This library is a C++ wrapper for the Nvidia C libraries (e.g. CUDA driver, nvrtc, cuFFT etc.). The main purposes are:  1. _easier resource management_, leading to _lower risk of programming errors_; 2. _better fault handling_ (through exceptions); 3. _more compact user code_.  This library also supports AMD GPUs through the HIP: C++ Heterogeneous-Compute Interface for Portability.  Originally, the API enforced RAII to even further reduce the risk of faulty code, but enforcing RAII and compatibility with (unmanaged) objects obtained outside this API are mutually exclusive.  ## Requirements  | Software    | Minimum version | | ----------- | ----------- | | CUDA        | 10.0 or later | | ROCM        | 6.1.0 or later | | CMake       | 3.17 or later | | gcc         | 9.3 or later  | | OS          | Linux distro (amd64) |  | Hardware    | Type | | ----------- | ----------- | | NVIDIA GPU  | [Pascal](https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/geforce/products/10series/architecture/) or newer| | AMD GPU     | RDNA2 or newer, CDNA2 or newer |    ## Usage  CMake is used to build cudawrappers. To build the library, run:  ```shell git clone https://github.com/nlesc-recruit/cudawrappers cd cudawrappers cmake -S . -B build make -C build ```  This creates a `build` directory. Since cudawrappers is header-only, no library objects will be built. For more details on the building requirements and testing, see the [developer documentation](README.dev.md).  To install cudawrappers to a specific location (e.g., ~/.local), use: ```shell cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/.local -S . -B build make -C build make -C build install ```  You can optionally select what cudawrappers components should be enabled by specifying the `CUDAWRAPPERS_COMPONENTS` option. To build all components, specify: `-DCUDAWRAPPERS_COMPONENTS=all`. By default, only the `cu` and `nvrtc` components are enabled. The other components include: `cufft`, `nvml` (CUDA only) and `nvtx`.  ### Enabling HIP Support  To enable HIP:  1. Add the following code to your project's `CMakeLists.txt` file:      ```cmake     enable_language(HIP)     set(CUDAWRAPPERS_BACKEND ""HIP"")     ```      Alternatively, use the `-DCUDAWRAPPERS_BACKEND=HIP` argument when running CMake.  2. Ensure that every target your project builds is 'hipfied'.     This is done by marking relevant source files as 'HIP' compatible:      ```cmake     set_source_files_properties(source.cpp PROPERTIES LANGUAGE HIP)     ```  3. Optionally, use `#ifdef (__HIP__)` directives in your source code to enable/disable certain sections for HIP.  4. **Build**: ensure that the `hipcc` compiler is selected.     This can be done via the command line:      ```shell     CXX=hipcc cmake -B build     ```  **Note**: When building for both NVIDIA and AMD HIP, using **seperate** build folders (e.g, `build_nvidia` and `build_amd`) is encouraged. Additionally, please note that contrary to CUDA, the HIP backend does not implement GPU contexts. For library interoperability, it provides a (non-functioning) mock implementation. Still, the usage of `cu::Context` is strongly discouraged, and has been marked deprecated since cudawrappers version `0.9.0`. Support will likely be dropped in a future release.",https://github.com/nlesc-recruit/cudawrappers,nlesc-recruit/cudawrappers

Such complex network variables show relations amongst geographical locations representing the movement of heat from a heatwave. The thesis was split up into two parts, where part one related to investigating the data to come up with proposed definitions for sources and sinks, and part two would take these definitions and propose machine learning methods to generalize the definitions to the available climatological period of 1990 to 2020. In the end, it was found that the input degree (ID), and output degree (OD) can best define sources and sink, as they describe the movement of heat amongst the network/ geographical locations. This resulted in sources and sinks being defined daily, where sources are defined by the maximum OD and minimum ID on a given day, whereas sinks would be defined by the minimum OD and maximum ID on a given day. Following these definitions, multiple nodes can be classified as a source or sink at the same time resulting in cloud-like structures. The definitions were further investigated using climatological expertise and unsupervised learning (i.e. one-class SVM) to explore if a clear distinction can be made between the two. Next, the proposed definitions were used to identify optimal models for generalizing to the available climatological period of 1990 to 2020. After extensive training and testing of six machine learning models (i.e. decision trees, random forest, adaptive boosting, gradient boosting, support vector machine, and gaussian naïve bayes), gaussian naïve bayes (GNB), gradient boosting (GB), and random forest (RF) were able to outperform the remaining three models recording higher f1-scores.&nbsp;",,

27f16ca2-6269-412a-8d68-5c3588e98947,noodles,Noodles,"- Enables scientists to execute and restart parallel workflows by readable and easily maintainable Python code - Helps to scale computations in Python with complex dependencies to a parallel environment - No need to leave the comfort of Python: Noodles is a thin layer, unobtrusively handling complexity of a concurrent environment.   Often, a computer program can be sped up by executing parts of its code _in parallel_ (simultaneously), as opposed to _synchronously_ (one part after another).  A simple example may be where you assign two variables, as follows  ``a = 2 * i``  and  ``b = 3 * i``.  Either statement is only dependent on ``i``, but whether you assign ``a`` before ``b`` or vice versa, does not matter for how your program works. Whenever this is the case, there is potential to speed up a program, because the assignment of ``a`` and ``b`` could be done in parallel, using multiple cores on your computer's CPU. Obviously, for simple assignments like  ``a = 2 * i``,  there is not much time to be gained, but what if ``a`` is the result of a time-consuming function, e.g.   ``a = very_difficult_function(i)``?  And what if your program makes many calls to that function, e.g.   ``list_of_a = [very_difficult_function(i) for i in list_of_i]``?  The potential speed-up could be tremendous.  So, parallel execution of computer programs is great for improving performance, but how do you tell the computer which parts should be executed in parallel, and which parts should be executed synchronously? How do you identify the order in which to execute each part, since the optimal order may be different from the order in which the parts appear in your program. These questions quickly become nearly impossible to answer as your program grows and changes during development. Because of this, many developers accept the slow execution of their program only because it saves them from the headaches associated with keeping track of which parts of their program depend on which other parts.  Enter Noodles.  Noodles is a Python package that can automatically construct a _callgraph_ for a given Python program, listing exactly which parts depend on which parts. Moreover, Noodles can subsequently use the callgraph to execute code in parallel on your local machine using multiple cores. If you so choose, you can even configure Noodles such that it will execute the code remotely, for example on a big compute node in a cluster computer.",https://github.com/NLeSC/noodles,NLeSC/noodles

The microscale fluid-structure interaction problem and the macroscale are coupled through an extended version of the Hill-Mandel principle, leading to a variationally consistent averaging scheme of the microscale fields. The effective macroscopic constitutive relations are obtained by expressing the microscale problem with a reduced-order model that contains the longwave basis and the so-called local resonance basis, yielding the closed-form expressions for the homogenized material properties. The resulting macroscopic model is an enriched porous continuum with internal variables that represent the microscale dynamics at the macroscale, whereby the Biot model is recovered as a special case. Numerical examples demonstrate the framework’s validity in modeling wave transmission through a porous layer.

Abstract  We explore the zero-shot setting for day-night domain adaptation. The traditional domain adaptation setting is to train on one domain and adapt to the target domain by exploiting unlabeled data samples from the test set. As gathering relevant test data is expensive and sometimes even impossible, we remove any reliance on test data imagery and instead exploit a visual inductive prior derived from physics-based reflection models for domain adaptation. We cast a number of color invariant edge detectors as trainable layers in a convolutional neural network and evaluate their robustness to illumination changes. We show that the color invariant layer reduces the day-night distribution shift in feature map activations throughout the network. We demonstrate improved performance for zero-shot day to night domain adaptation on both synthetic as well as natural datasets in various tasks, including classification, segmentation and place recognition.",https://data.4tu.nl/v3/datasets/97147efb-7946-40aa-8053-299da69f22f0.git,

Emphasis is placed  on the calculation of the cornering resistance power and power lost due to  scrub losses to research the effect of these tire-effect on the vehicle energy  consumption.    The current model includes six wheels, where the two sets of double rear  wheels have individual rotational velocities. In the model derivation,  linearizations are avoided: large angles are allowed and the non-linear Magic  Formula is employed to calculate the tire forces. Additionally, lateral load  transfer effects, due to the elevated center of gravity (CoG), are included.  The developed non-linear model has four degrees of freedom. Steady-state  solutions of the model are determined iteratively using an adapted Newton  scheme. The model enables the calculation of all tire velocities and tire  forces for a given cornering situation characterized by the cornering radius  rho and the vehicle velocity v.

However, existing approaches exhibit shortcomings, such as being prone to inaccuracies or being computationally prohibitive. Addressing these challenges, a recent innovation in closure for the method of moments is the introduction of quadrature based moments methods (QBMM). Discretising a distribution by a number of discrete elements, QBMM facilitate efficient and accurate tracking of density distributions, particularly for particle size distributions (PSD). However, obtaining the full particle size distribution information using these methods requires reconstructing the distribution from a finite set of moments, which is not a trivial step.  This study introduces a novel integration of the maximum entropy reconstruction (MER) into QBMM, establishing a robust and rapid framework for the time evolution and reconstruction of PSDs. As proof of concept for this framework, we focus on the direct quadrature method of moments (DQMOM) with spatially homogeneous and monovariate distributions. We show that coupling of MER with DQMOM has numerous advantages. To verify the framework, special cases of constant growth, aggregation, and breakage are considered for which analytical solutions can be found.  Furthermore, we show the advantage of using DQMOM with volume-based over length-based distributions, and address numerical as well as theoretical issues. Validation of the framework is successfully conducted on the evolution of the PSD from a twin-screw wet granulation dataset, considering all primary physical mechanisms inherent in a wet granulation process, namely growth, aggregation, and breakage. This showcases the consistency of the proposed framework and underscores its applicability to real-world scenarios.  The software consists of a fully working MATLAB (Version R2023a) script for a non-dimensional and dimensional direct quadrature method of moments coupled to a maximum entropy reconstruction. Additional methods that are needed to run the quadrature method of moments (reading in data, adaptive Wheeler algorithm, kernels, etc.) and the maximum entropy reconstruction (Gaussian qudrature, Cholesky inversion, etc.) including input data consisting of different density distributions from a twin-screw wet granulation dataset are available.

NatureCounts allows people interested in birds, whether for conservation, research or their personal enjoyment, to interact with one of the largest datasets on birds anywhere in the world.  NatureCounts is bringing together observation data on birds and other biodiversity including data from:  * bird-monitoring * bird-banding * broad-scale citizen-based bird-surveillance programs.  NatureCounts is a portal of the [Avian Knowledge Network](https://avianknowledge.net/) (AKN). While the focus of NatureCounts is primarily on Canadian birds, you will also find other data from projects coordinated by Birds Canada and its partners, including data on other taxonomic groups (e.g. the Trinational Monarch Knowledge Network portal), and some ranging to other regions (mainly within North America). Some of the same data are available through other AKN nodes, but others are only available from this site. You can access a complete list of all datasets available for download from NatureCounts [here](https://naturecounts.ca/nc/default/datasets.jsp), and you can use our [data request page](https://naturecounts.ca/nc/default/searchquery.jsp) to submit a request. You can also consult a list of other [AKN partners](https://avianknowledge.net/?page=nodes) where you can access additional data.  One of the core strengths of NatureCounts is an extensive database that combines data from hundreds of different sources, all using a common standard defined by the [Avian Knowledge Network](https://avianknowledge.net/), called the [Bird Monitoring Data Exchange](https://naturecounts.ca/nc/default/nc_bmde.jsp) (BMDE). This format makes it easy to combine datasets and removes some of the usual barriers related to accessibility and formats, rapid discovery, access, and analysis of these vast resources.  The goals of NatureCounts and the Avian Knowledge Network are to:  * educate the public on the dynamics of bird populations * provide interactive decision-making tools for land managers * make available a data resource for scientific research * advance new exploratory analysis techniques to study bird populations.  **NatureCounts** is a node of the Avian Knowledge Network, and aims to provide access to bird monitoring data and facilate the understanding of the patterns and dynamics of bird populations across the Western Hemisphere.  # What data are included in NatureCounts  There are literally hundreds of datasets available in NatureCounts, representing well over 100 million occurrences of birds. These include virtually all of Birds Canada’s monitoring initiatives, such as Breeding Bird Atlases, eBird Canada, the Marsh Monitoring Program, Nocturnal Owl Surveys, as well as many other major initiatives to which BSC contributes in some capacity (Canadian Migration Monitoring Program, Hawk Count and the Raptor Population Index, the Trinational Monarch Knowledge Network, the Breeding Bird Survey, the Christmas Bird Count, etc.).  While several of the datasets are primarily managed by our partners, such as the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, National Audubon Society, Environment Canada, etc., others are managed Birds Canada through one of our data entry tools within NatureCounts.  It should also be mentioned that one of the other resources managed by Birds Canada’s National Data Centre, but currently not available through NatureCounts, is the [Motus Wildlife Tracking System}(https://motus.org/), a network of automated telemetry stations allowing us to track individual birds fitted with radio transmitters as they move through the landscape, and feeding vast amounts of data into BSC’s national databases.  # What can you do with the data?  * You can explore the data resources of NatureCounts via interactive maps that allow you to view the distribution of bird populations any time of the year and across a variety of different sources. * You can obtain and visualize information on long term [population trends](https://naturecounts.ca/nc/default/popindices.jsp) of Canadian birds. * You can explore an individual species pattern of distribution or the species richness of a particular location via dynamically generated [summary tables and graphs](https://naturecounts.ca/nc/default/datasummaries.jsp). * Finally, much of the observational data can be directly [accessed and downloaded](https://naturecounts.ca/nc/default/searchquery.jsp)  # How are NatureCounts data being used?  NatureCounts has provided mission critical data to thousands of users, for a wide range of applications, including academic research, student projects and a diverse array of conservation uses (COSEWIC status reports, consultant industries, etc.). We are always looking for examples of how NatureCounts data are being used. If you have published manuscripts or reports using bird monitoring data made available by NatureCounts, or developed a data visualization or analysis, [please share with us](https://naturecounts.ca/nc/default/contact.jsp)!  NatureCounts data also serve as the basis for tracking bird status within Canadian [Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas](https://ibacanada.org/) (IBA).

The problem consists of finding a decomposition of a network of dynamical systems into system units for which local controllers can be designed. Unfortunately, despite its critical role, a generalized approach to partitioning applicable to every system is still missing from the literature. This paper introduces a novel partitioning framework that integrates an algorithmic selection of fundamental system units (FSUs), considered indivisible entities, with an aggregative procedure, either algorithmic or optimization-based, to select composite system units (CSUs) made of several FSUs. A key contribution is the introduction of a global network metric, the partition index, which quantitatively balances intra- and inter-CSU interactions, with a granularity parameter accounting for the size of CSUs, allowing for their selection at different levels of aggregation. The proposed method is validated through case studies in distributed model predictive control (DMPC) for linear and hybrid systems, showing significant reductions in computation time and cost while maintaining or improving control performance w.r.t. conventional strategies.",https://data.4tu.nl/v3/datasets/2246b13d-f3db-49ee-b9ab-264eb5584bba.git,

The [`MycoAI-CNN.pt`](https://zenodo.org/records/10904344) model is automatically downloaded to this folder if it is not there, and the vector database is created and named after the model.    ### Conduct a semantic search with FASTA file ```python from taxotagger import ProjectConfig from taxotagger import TaxoTagger  config = ProjectConfig() tt = TaxoTagger(config)  # semantic search and return the top 1 result for each query sequence res = tt.search('data/query.fasta', limit = 1) ```  The [`data/query.fasta` file](https://github.com/MycoAI/taxotagger/tree/main/data) contains two query sequences: `KY106088` and `KY106087`.   The search results `res` will be a dictionary with taxonomic level names as keys and matched results as values for each of the two query sequences. For example, `res['phylum']` will look like:  ```python [     [{""id"": ""KY106088"", ""distance"": 1.0, ""entity"": {""phylum"": ""Ascomycota""}}],     [{""id"": ""KY106087"", ""distance"": 0.9999998807907104, ""entity"": {""phylum"": ""Ascomycota""}}] ] ```  The first inner list is the top results for the first query sequence, and the second inner list is the top results for the second query sequence.  The `id` field is the sequence ID of the matched sequence. The `distance` field is the cosine similarity between the query sequence and the matched sequence with a value between 0 and 1, the closer to 1, the more similar. The `entity` field is the taxonomic information of the matched sequence.   We can see that the top 1 results for both query sequences are exactly themselves. This is because the query sequences are also in the database. You can try with different query sequences to see the search results.   ## Docs Please visit the [official documentation](https://mycoai.github.io/taxotagger) for more details.  ## Question and feedback Please submit [an issue](https://github.com/MycoAI/taxotagger/issues) if you have any question or feedback.",https://github.com/MycoAI/taxotagger,MycoAI/taxotagger

Authors of STOKE make some extraordinary claims. They suggest that it is able to produce programs that are multiple times faster than programs without any optimization, and programs which are at least as efficient as programs produced by gcc -O3 and sometimes expert handwritten assembly. The goal of this paper is to check these claims. In this paper classes of programs that STOKE may handle particularly well and any class of programs that stochastic optimization might not be able to handle will be identified. We conclude from the experiments described in this paper that STOKE is able to fulfill that statement in some cases. The searching algorithm of STOKE is not always able to find programs that are at least as efficient as programs optimized by gcc -O3. STOKE works particularly well in programs where a lot consecutive logical and mathematical operations are calculating (e.g. counting bits). It is often not that successful with programs containing loops where it sometimes can’t find a solution at all.",,

Abstract  Color is a crucial visual cue readily exploited by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for object recognition. However, CNNs struggle if there is data imbalance between color variations introduced by accidental recording conditions. Color invariance addresses this issue but does so at the cost of removing all color information, which sacrifices discriminative power. In this paper, we propose Color Equivariant Convolutions (CEConvs), a novel deep learning building block that enables shape feature sharing across the color spectrum while retaining important color information. We extend the notion of equivariance from geometric to photometric transformations by incorporating parameter sharing over hue-shifts in a neural network. We demonstrate the benefits of CEConvs in terms of downstream performance to various tasks and improved robustness to color changes, including train-test distribution shifts. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated into existing architectures, such as ResNets, and offers a promising solution for addressing color-based domain shifts in CNNs.",https://data.4tu.nl/v3/datasets/2ab28fae-8cbf-4640-8da3-c284e89dc06c.git,

It is primarily intended for physicochemical processes involving significant convective flow. OpenCMP uses the NGSolve finite element library for spatial discretization and provides a configuration file-based interface to pre-implemented models and time discretization schemes. It provides built-in post-processing and error analysis and also integrates with Netgen, Gmsh, and ParaView for meshing and visualization of simulation results.  OpenCMP development follows the principles of ease of use, performance, and extensibility. The configuration file-based user interface is intended to be concise, readable, and intuitive. Similarly, the code base is structured such that experienced users can add their own models with minimal modifications to existing code. Inclusion of the finite element method enables the use of high-order polynomial interpolants for increased simulation accuracy. OpenCMP also offers the discontinuous Galerkin method which is locally conservative and improves simulation stability for convection-dominated problems. Finally, OpenCMP implements the diffuse interface method, a form of immersed boundary method which allows the use of non-conforming structured meshes for even complex simulation domains to improve simulation stability and sometimes speed.  Examples and tutorial files can be found in the ""Examples"" directory.

A powerful approach is to use multi-qubit network nodes which provide the quantum memory and computational power to perform entanglement distillation, quantum error correction,and information processing. Nuclear spins associated with optically-active defects in diamond are promising qubits for this role. However, their dephasing during entanglement distribution across the optical network hinders scaling to larger systems. In this work, we show that a single 13C spin in isotopically engineered diamond offers a long-lived quantum memory that is robust to the optical link operation. The memory lifetime is improved by two orders-of-magnitude over the longest reported value, and exceeds the best reported times for making photonic entanglement. We identify ionisation of the NV center as a newly limiting decoherence mechanism. As a first step towards overcoming this limitation, we demonstrate that the nuclear spin state can be retrieved with high fidelity after a complete cycle of ionisation and recapture. Finally, we use numerical simulations to show that the combination of this improved memory lifetime with previously demonstrated entanglement links and gate operations can enable key primitives for quantum networks, such as deterministic nonlocal two-qubit logic operations and GHZ state creation across four network nodes. Our results pave the way for test-bed quantum networks capable of investigating complex algorithms and error correction.",,

The speed of recovery after a disturbance is known to be correlated with the concept of resilience. This is true not only for forests, but for many dynamical systems. To put it simply: forests that recover fast are more resilient. Forests that recover slowly may be in danger of permanent disappearance.  The specialized literature proposes different metrics for measuring the recovery speed. The performance of these metrics depends on many factors. Some of them are natural, such as the intensity of the perturbation or the seasonality.

Furthermore, by exploiting the symmetries of the input states, we find all protocols for up to n=8 copies of a Werner state. For the latter case, we present circuits that achieve the highest fidelity with perfect operations and no decoherence. These circuits have modest depth and number of two-qubit gates. Our results are based on a correspondence between distillation protocols and double cosets of the symplectic group, and improve on previously known protocols.",,

Description     The task is to predict probabilities for anomalous transactions, from a  synthetic database of international transactions, and several synthetic  databases of banking account information. We provide two solutions. One  solution, our centralized approach, found in `solution_centralized.py`,  uses the transactions database (PNS) and the banking database with no  privacy protections. The second solution, which provides robust privacy  gurantees outlined in our report, follows a federated architecture,  found in `solution_federated.py` and model.py. In this approach, PNS  data resides in one client, banking data is divided up accross other  clients, and an aggregator handles all the communication between any  clients. We have built in privacy protections so that clients and the  aggregator learn minimal information about each other, while engaging in  communication to detect anomalous transactions in PNS.     The way in which we conduct training and inference in both the  centralized and the federated architectures is fundamentally the same  (other than the privacy protections in the latter). Several new features  are engineered from the given PNS data. Then a model is trained on those  features from PNS. Next, during inference, a check is made to determine  if attributes from a PNS transaction match with the banking data, or if  the associated account in the banking data is flagged. If any of these  attributes are amiss, we give it a value of 1, and a 0 otherwise.  Lastly, we take the maximum of the inferred probabilities from the PNS  model, and the result from the Banking data validation, which is used as  our final prediction for the probability that the transaction is  anomalous.     The difference between the federated and centralized logic is that in  the federated set up, where there are one or multiple partitions of the  banking data across clients, is that the PNS client engages in a  cryptographic protocol based on homomorphic encryption with the banking  clients, routed through the aggregator, to perform feature extraction.  This protocol, to ensure privacy, and that PNS does not learn anything  from the banks beyond the set membership of a select few features, is  carried out over several rounds, r. r = 7 + n, where n is the number of  bank clients.",https://data.4tu.nl/v3/datasets/2851fb4d-9c4f-498d-9ade-446399e45e08.git,

In the implementation it has been opted to model the physical geometry as a composition of rectangular two-dimensional subdomains, hence initially restricting the implementation to orthogonal and two-dimensional situations. The strategy of using subdomains divides the problem domain into local subsets, which enables the simulation software to be built according to Object-Oriented Programming best practices and allows room for further computational parallelization.

An example of the GameBus Excel file is provided as [gamebus.xlsx](gamebus.xlsx).  ## Requirements  - [Deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/installation)  If you have deno installed, it's a good practice to update it to lastest version using the command: `deno upgrade`.  ## Usage  ### Run the typescript package directly:  ```shell # run conversion deno run --allow-read --allow-write https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nwo-strap/excel-to-fhir/main/excel-to-fhir.ts -f example-excel.xlsx -s sheetname1 sheetname2 -j mapping1.jsonata mapping2.jsonata  # show help deno run --allow-read --allow-write https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nwo-strap/excel-to-fhir/main/excel-to-fhir.ts -h ```  ### Run the typescript package as a command line tool  If you want to install the package as CLI tool and run:  ```shell # install deno install --allow-read --allow-write https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nwo-strap/excel-to-fhir/main/excel-to-fhir.ts  # run conversion excel-to-fhir -f example-excel.xlsx -s sheetname1 sheetname2 -j mapping1.jsonata mapping2.jsonata  # show help excel-to-fhir --help ```  ### Run Deno tasks  You can define [Deno tasks](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/tools/task_runner) in the [deno.json](deno.json) file with specific inputs and options.  In the file you can find the task `transform`, which is defined to convert [gamebus.xlsx](gamebus.xlsx) file to FHIR resources with all valid sheets (with all corresponding jsonata files). You can run the conversion with the following command:  ```shell # clone the repo git clone https://github.com/nwo-strap/excel-to-fhir.git cd excel-to-fhir  # run the task deno task transform ```",https://github.com/nwo-strap/excel-to-fhir,nwo-strap/excel-to-fhir

However, the law is somewhat open to interpretation. This interpretation is done by judges whenever a case is brought to court. Over time, the outcome of individual cases build what is called _case law_.  Because consistency is crucial for the fair application of the law, cases often reference other cases: if the reasoning behind a ruling in one case also applies to another case, then the ruling should be the same. To warrant consistency it is thus paramount that any relevant rulings from previous cases are identified. Conventionally, both the justice department and the defense depend on legal experts to make this identification when preparing a case. However, court rulings are often difficult to understand, there is only limited time available, and even experts are not aware of all cases that may be relevant.  To help mitigate this situation, the Netherlands eScience Center worked together with Maastricht University to develop an [interactive visualization](https://www.research-software.nl/software/case-law-app) that assists the legal community at large (prosecutors, judges, lawyers, legal aids, but also researchers and students) in analyzing case law.   To analyze a specific topic or theme in the law, a collection of law cases first need to be represented as a network or _graph_.  Each node in the graph represents a case, while the edges represent references to other cases.

506939b9-7eb3-40e3-a5ad-8511be18efdb,icdgems,ICD_GEMs.jl,"## Overview   ### ICD  The ICD provides a common language for the classification of diseases, injuries and causes of death, and for the standardised reporting and monitoring of health conditions. It is designed to map health conditions to corresponding generic categories together with specific variations, assigning to these a designated code, up to six characters long. These data form the basis of comparison and sharing between health providers, regions and countries, and over periods.  In addition to this essential core function, the ICD can also inform a wide range of related activities. It is used for health insurance reimbursement; in national health programme management; by data collection specialists and researchers; for tracking progress in global health; and to determine the allocation of health resources. Patient quality and safety documentation is also heavily informed by the ICD.  The ICD system is designed to promote international comparability in the collection, processing, classification, and presentation of health statistics, and health information in general. Currently, 117 countries report causes of death to WHO. Seventy per cent of the world’s health resources are allocated based on ICD data. Current uses include cancer registration, pharmacovigilance, and more than 20,000 scientific articles cite ICD-10.  For further details about the ICD, please consider to read the [References](#References).  ### GEMs  The General Equivalence Mappings (GEMs) are the product of a coordinated effort spanning several years and involving the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA), the American Hospital Association, and 3M Health Information Systems providing a temporary mechanism to link ICD-9 codes to ICD-10 and vice versa.   According to the CMS:   > The purpose of the GEMs is to create a useful, practical, code to code translation reference dictionary for both code sets, and to offer acceptable translation alternatives wherever possible. For each code set, it endeavors to answer this question: Taking the complete meaning of a code (defined as: all correctly coded conditions or procedures that would be classified to a code based on the code title, all associated tabular instructional notes, and all index references that refer to a code) as a single unit, what are the most appropriate translation(s) to the other code set?  For further details on how the GEMs work, please consider to read the [References](#References).  ## Installation  Press `]` in the Julia REPL and then  ```julia pkg> add ICD_GEMs ```  ## Tutorial   Let us showcase the features of the package.  First, we import the necessary packages:  ```julia using ICD_GEMs ```  The GEMs converting ICD-10 codes into ICD-9 and viceversa have already been downloaded from [here](https://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Publications/ICD10CM/2018/Dxgem_2018.zip) and exported both as `DataFrame` s from [DataFrames.jl](https://github.com/JuliaData/DataFrames.jl) and `OrderedDict`s from [DataStructures.jl](https://github.com/JuliaCollections/DataStructures.jl):  - `GEM_I10_I9_dataframe`:  GEM from ICD-10 to ICD-9 represented as a dataframe; - `GEM_I10_I9_dictionary`:  GEM from ICD-10 to ICD-9 represented as a dictionary; - `GEM_I9_I10_dataframe`:  GEM from ICD-9 to ICD-10 represented as a dataframe; - `GEM_I9_I10_dictionary`:  GEM from ICD-10 to ICD-9 represented as a dictionary.  These are all `GEM` structs consisting of two fields:  - `data`: The actual GEM, which may either be a dataframe or a dictionary; - `direction`: A string, either `""I10_I9""` or `""I9_I10""`.  The package can be used with custom GEMs (or ""applied mappings"") as long as they are wrapped inside a `GEM` struct where the `data` field is either a dataframe or a dictionary with the exact same format as the exported ones above. If some new GEMs are released by the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/Comprehensive-Listing-of-ICD-10-CM-Files.htm), the functions that load CDC-formatted .txt files are exported:  ```julia path      = ""path/to/txt"" direction = ""I10_I9"" # If the GEM translates from ICD-10 to ICD-9, otherwise ""I9_I10"" gem       = get_GEM_dataframe_from_cdc_gem_txt(path, direction) # Or get_GEM_dictionary_from_cdc_gem_txt(path, direction) ```  Finally, let us show how to translate ICD-10 codes into ICD-9 for, as an example, neoplasms:  ```julia ICD_10_neoplasms = ""C00-D48"" # This is equivalent as explicitly specifiying all codes from C00.XX to D48.XX ICD_9_neoplasm   = execute_applied_mapping(GEM_I10_I9_dictionary, [""C00-D48""])   ```  ```nothing 932-element Vector{String}:  ""1400""  ""1401""  ""1409""  ""1403""  ""1404""  ""1405""  ""1406""  ""1408""  ""1410""  ⋮  ""23877""  ""2380""  ""2381""  ""2354""  ""2382""  ""2383""  ""2388""  ""2389"" ```  And back:  ```julia ICD_10_neoplasm_back   = execute_applied_mapping(GEM_I9_I10_dictionary, ICD_9_neoplasm) ```  ```nothing 1186-element Vector{String}:  ""C000""  ""C001""  ""C002""  ""C003""  ""C004""  ""C005""  ""C006""  ""C008""  ""C01""  ⋮  ""D480""  ""D481""  ""D483""  ""D484""  ""D485""  ""D4860""  ""D487""  ""D489"" ```  Are these the same as all the codes we started from, namely all ICD-10 codes from the first starting with `C00` to the last that starts with `D48` ? These would be:  ```julia get_ICD_code_range(""C00-D48"", ""ICD-10"") # Specify a code range and the revision it belongs to ```  ```nothing 1622-element Vector{String}:  ""C000""  ""C001""  ""C002""  ""C003""  ""C004""  ""C005""  ""C006""  ""C008""  ""C009""  ⋮  ""D483""  ""D484""  ""D485""  ""D4860""  ""D4861""  ""D4862""  ""D487""  ""D489"" ```  No, they are more! Why? Because the mapping between the two revisions is not injective nor surjective (see the [official documentation](https://github.com/JuliaHealth/ICD_GEMs.jl/tree/main/official_gem_documentation)).   More complex translations, involving both single codes and ranges with arbitrary precision on both ends, can be performed:  ```julia execute_applied_mapping(GEM_I10_I9_dictionary, [""I60-I661"", ""I670"", ""I672-I679""]) ```  **Note**: All codes must be specified and are returned by the translation utilities without punctuation (no dot before the decimal digits).  ## How to Contribute  If you wish to change or add some functionality, please file an [issue](https://github.com/JuliaHealth/ICD_GEMs.jl/issues).   ## How to Cite   If you use this package in your work, please cite this repository using the metadata in [`CITATION.bib`](https://github.com/JuliaHealth/ICD_GEMs.jl/blob/main/CITATION.bib).  ## Announcements   - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/In_Phy_T/status/1529444377281671168?s=20&t=O7f9qRLdsyY8WM3TEdCWLg) - [Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/ann-icd-gems-jl-a-package-to-translate-between-icd-9-and-icd-10-codes/81679?u=pietromonticone) - [Forem](https://forem.julialang.org/inphyt/ann-icdgemsjl-a-package-to-translate-between-icd-9-and-icd-10-codes-17am)  ## References   - Butler (2007), [ICD-10 General Equivalence Mappings: Bridging the Translation Gap from ICD-9](https://library.ahima.org/doc?oid=74265#.Ynre9i8RoiM), *Journal of AHIMA* - CMS (2018), [2018 ICD-10 CM and GEMs](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD10/2018-ICD-10-CM-and-GEMs) - NCHS-CDC (2018), [Diagnosis Code Set General Equivalence Mappings: ICD-10-CM to ICD-9-CM and ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM](https://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/health_statistics/nchs/publications/ICD10CM/2018/Dxgem_guide_2018.pdf)  - NCHS-CDC (2022), [Comprehensive Listing ICD-10-CM Files](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/Comprehensive-Listing-of-ICD-10-CM-Files.htm) (download General Equivalence Mappings [here](https://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Publications/ICD10CM/2018/Dxgem_2018.zip)) - WHO (2022), [ICD-11 Implementation or Transition Guide](https://icd.who.int/docs/ICD-11%20Implementation%20or%20Transition%20Guide_v105.pdf)",https://github.com/JuliaHealth/ICD_GEMs.jl,JuliaHealth/ICD_GEMs.jl

Just read your YAML file into a document structure (a tree of nested dicts and lists), and manipulate that in your code.  While this works fine for simple file formats, it does not scale very well to more complex file formats such as the Common Workflow Language (CWL) or the Multiscale Computing Language (yMCL). Manual error-checking is lots of work and error-prone, defaults are not set automatically (which is especially tricky if you have multiple nested optional objects), and the file format often ends up somewhat underspecified.  Furthermore, a small collection of nested dicts and lists may work fine, but for more complex file formats, this becomes unwieldy and a set of objects is a better choice. Although it is not often used this way, YAML is actually a fully fledged object-to-text serialisation protocol. The Python yaml and ruamel.yaml libraries will actually construct objects for you, but the class names need to be put in the YAML file for that to work, which makes those files harder to read and write for humans.  YAtiML is a helper library that helps address these issues. With YAtiML, you have easy-to-read YAML for the user, and easy-to-use objects for the programmer, with validation and automatic type recognition in between.",https://github.com/yatiml/yatiml,yatiml/yatiml

In this study, I performed an analysis of photosynthetic efficiency at high irradiance in ten species that reflect key evolutionary events within the Brassicaceae family: Arabidopsis thaliana, Brassica oleracea, Brassica nigra, Brassica rapa, Brassica tournefortii, Erucastrum littoreum, Hirschfeldia incana, Sinapis alba, Sisymbrium irio, and Zahora ait-atta. I made use of high-throughput phenotyping techniques to measure photosynthetic efficiency, and integrated these measurements with other image-based parameters, such as the Excess Green Index (ExGI) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), as well as a range of anatomical and biochemical characteristics that potentially influence photosynthetic efficiency. I then explored the resulting multivariate dataset using various statistical methods to identify trends across species and investigated if more species within the Brassicaceae family show high-photosynthetic LUE at high irradiance. Furthermore, I assessed the alignment of these trends with the evolutionary history of the Brassicaceae family. This study delivers a detailed description of inter-specific variation in photosynthetic parameters for the Brassicaceae family, completed by a selection of anatomical and biochemical characteristics that may play a role in supporting high photosynthetic LUE under high irradiance. The gained insights will be important in developing strategies to enhance the photosynthetic LUE at high irradiance of crop species.",https://data.4tu.nl/v3/datasets/38581506-079f-4470-a149-dc02a09d5b45.git,

Its target audience is researchers who wish to systematically study content on social media platforms that resist conventional scraping or  API-based data collection.  You can, for example, browse TikTok and later export a list of all posts you saw in the order you saw them in. Data can  be exported as a JSON file or exported to a [4CAT](https://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/4cat) instance for  analysis and storage. Zeeschuimer is primarily intended as a companion to 4CAT, but you can also integrate its output into your own analysis pipeline.  Currently, it supports the following platforms: * [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com) (posts and comments) * [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com) (posts only) * [X/Twitter](https://www.x.com) * [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com) * [9gag](https://9gag.com) * [Imgur](https://imgur.com) * [Douyin](https://douyin.com) * [Gab](https://gab.com)  Platform support requires regular maintenance to keep up with changes to the platforms. If something does not work, we welcome issues and pull requests. See 'Limitations' below for some known limitations to data capture.  The extension does not interfere with your normal browsing and never uploads data automatically, only when you explicitly ask it to do so. It uses the [WebRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/webRequest) browser API to locally collect and parse the data search engines are sending to your browser as you use it.  ## Installation Zeeschuimer is in active development. .xpi files that you can use to install it in your browser are available on the  [releases](https://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/zeeschuimer/releases) page. These are signed and can be installed  in any Firefox-based browser. If you want to run the latest development version instead, you can [do so from the Firefox debugging console](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7el77F1ckg) after cloning the repository locally.  ## How to use A [guide to using Zeeschuimer and 4CAT](https://tinyurl.com/nmrw-zeeschuimer-tiktok) is available. Basic instructions  are as follows:   Install the browser extension in a Firefox browser. A button with the Zeeschuimer logo (a 'Z') will appear in the  browser toolbar. Click it to open the Zeeschuimer interface. Enable capturing for the sites you want to capture from.  Next, simply browse a supported platform's site. You will see the amount of items detected per platform increase as you  browse. When you have the items you need, you can export the data as an [ndjson](https://ndjson.org) file, or upload it to a 4CAT instance where a 4CAT dataset will be created from the uploaded items. You can then run 4CAT's analytical  processors on the data.  To upload to 4CAT, copy the URL of the website of the 4CAT instance to the ""4CAT instance"" field at the top of  Zeeschuimer's interface. You can then use the ""to 4CAT"" button to create a new 4CAT dataset from the captured data.  After uploading, Zeeschuimer will show you a link and the ten most recently uploaded datasets are shown at the bottom of the interface.  Don't forget to reset the data as needed. For example, if you want to create a dataset for a given TikTok hashtag, first reset the TikTok data in Zeeschuimer, _then_ go to the hashtag's ""Explore"" page on TikTok, and then upload the dataset when you've scrolled down enough to be satisfied with the amount of items.  If you find yourself scrolling a lot to collect data, consider using another browser extension to do it for you, for  example [FoxScroller](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxscroller/).  ## Limitations  Due to the technical limitations, it may not be possible to collect all items from all 'views' for each supported  platform. The following limitations are known:  * *Instagram* items that cannot be captured:   * Stories   * Posts from the 'Tagged' and 'Reels' tabs on a profile page   * Posts from the 'Saved' overview of bookmarked posts   * Posts from the 'For You' feed on the 'Explore' page (the 'Not personalized' feed _does_ work)   * 'Suggested for you' and 'Sponsored' posts on the front page feed * *TikTok* items that cannot be captured:   * Live streams  Note that these are *known* limitations; data capture may break or change based on platform changes. Always  cross-reference captured data with what you are seeing in your browser.  ## Credits & license Zeeschuimer was developed by Stijn Peeters for the [Digital Methods Initiative](https://digitalmethods.net) and is  licensed under the Mozilla Public License, 2.0.

What this boils down to, is the fact that it is often restrictive and difficult, if not impossible, to formulate adequate selection criteria, in particular for more complex or abstract concepts, in the framework of a keyword based search which is the standard entry point to digitized text collections.  ## Querying by example - close reading with tailored suggestions `evidence` provides an alternative, intuitive entry point into collections by leveraging the doc2vec framework. Using doc2vec `evidence` learns abstract representations of the theme and content of the elements of the user's corpus. Then, instead of trying to translate the scientific query into keywords, after compiling a set of relevant elements as starting points, i.e. examples of the concept the user is interested in, the user can query the corpus based on these examples of their concept of interest. Specifically, `evidence` retrieves elements with similar abstract representations and presents them to the user, using the users feedback to refine its retrieval. Furthermore, this concept-based query mode is complemented by the ability to perform additional retrieval using `more-like-this` context based retrieval function provided by `elasticsearch`. Together, this enables a user to combine the power of a close-reading approach with that of a large digitized corpus, selecting elements from the entire corpus which are likely to be of interest, but leaving the decision up to the user as to what evidence they deem useful.",https://github.com/ADAH-EviDENce/evidence,ADAH-EviDENce/evidence

56b5c24c-91b5-4747-8b52-47be9f4fc681,haddock3,haddock3,"# A brief introduction to HADDOCK3  HADDOCK3 is the next generation integrative modelling software in the long-lasting HADDOCK project. It represents a complete rethinking and rewriting of the HADDOCK2.X series, implementing a new way to interact with HADDOCK and offering new features to users who can now define custom workflows.  In the previous HADDOCK2.x versions, users had access to a highly parameterisable yet rigid simulation pipeline composed of three steps: `ridig-body docking (it0)`, `semi-flexible refinement (it1)`, and `final refinement (itw)`.  ![HADDOCK 2.x workflow](https://github.com/haddocking/haddock3/raw/main/docs/figs/HADDOCK2-stages.png)  In HADDOCK3, users have the freedom to configure docking workflows into functional pipelines by combining the different HADDOCK3 modules, thus adapting the workflows to their projects. HADDOCK3 has therefore developed to truthfully work like a puzzle of many pieces (simulation modules) that users can combine freely. To this end, the “old” HADDOCK machinery has been modularised, and several new modules added, including third-party software. As a result, the modularisation achieved in HADDOCK3 allows users to duplicate steps within one workflow (e.g., to repeat the `it1` stage of the HADDOCK2.x rigid workflow).  Note that, for simplification purposes, at this time, not all functionalities of HADDOCK2.x have been ported to HADDOCK3, which does not (yet) support NMR RDC, PCS and diffusion anisotropy restraints, cryo-EM restraints and coarse-graining. Any type of information that can be converted into ambiguous interaction restraints can, however, be used in HADDOCK3, which also supports the *ab initio* docking modes of HADDOCK.  ![HADDOCK3 workflow](https://github.com/haddocking/haddock3/raw/main/docs/figs/HADDOCK3-workflow-scheme.png)  To keep HADDOCK3's modules organised, we catalogued them into several categories. But, there are no constraints on piping modules of different categories.  The main module's categories are ""topology"", ""sampling"", ""refinement"", ""scoring"", and ""analysis"". There is no limit to how many modules can belong to a category. Modules are added as developed, and new categories will be created if/when needed. You can access the HADDOCK3 documentation page for the list of all categories and modules. Below is a summary of the available modules:  * **Topology modules**     * `topoaa`: *generates the all-atom topologies for the CNS engine.* * **Sampling modules**     * `rigidbody`: *Rigid body energy minimisation with CNS (`it0` in haddock2.x).*     * `lightdock`: *Third-party Glow-worm Swarm Optimisation (GSO) docking software.*     * `gdock`: *Third-party genetic algorithm-based docking software.* * **Model refinement modules**     * `flexref`: *Semi-flexible refinement using a simulated annealing protocol through molecular dynamics simulations in torsion angle space (`it1` in haddock2.x).*     * `emref`: *Refinement by energy minimisation (`itw` EM only in haddock2.4).*     * `mdref`: *Refinement by a short molecular dynamics simulation in explicit solvent (`itw` in haddock2.X).* * **Scoring modules**     * `emscoring`: *scoring of a complex performing a short EM (builds the topology and all missing atoms).*     * `mdscoring`: *scoring of a complex performing a short MD in explicit solvent + EM (builds the topology and all missing atoms).* * **Analysis modules**     * `alascan`: *Performs alanine scanning on the models generated in the previous step.*     * `caprieval`: *Calculates CAPRI metrics (i-RMDS, l-RMSD, Fnat, DockQ) with respect to the top scoring model or reference structure if provided.*     * `contactmap`: *Calculates the contact maps for the models generated in the previous step.*     * `clustfcc`: *Clusters models based on the fraction of common contacts (FCC)*     * `clustrmsd`: *Clusters models based on pairwise RMSD matrix calculated with the `rmsdmatrix` module.*     * `ilrmsdmatrix`: *Calculates the pairwise iLRMSD matrix between all the models generated in the previous step.*     * `rmsdmatrix`: *Calculates the pairwise RMSD matrix between all the models generated in the previous step.*     * `seletop`: *Selects the top N models from the previous step.*     * `seletopclusts`: *Selects top N clusters from the previous step.*  The HADDOCK3 workflows are defined in simple configuration text files, similar to the TOML format but with extra features. Here is an example of a configuration file that would reproduce the HADDOCK2.x rigid workflow:  ```toml run_dir = ""run1-protein-protein"" ncores = 40 mode = ""local""  # molecules to be docked molecules =  [     ""data/e2aP_1F3G.pdb"",     ""data/hpr_ensemble.pdb""     ]  [topoaa]  [rigidbody] ambig_fname = ""data/e2a-hpr_air.tbl""  [seletop]  [flexref] ambig_fname = ""data/e2a-hpr_air.tbl""  [emref] ambig_fname = ""data/e2a-hpr_air.tbl""  [clustfcc]  [caprieval] ```  In this example only very few parameters are defined as most correspond to the default ones defined for each module. The sampling in this case would be 1000 rigidbody models and 200 for the refinement stages. Clustering is based on the fraction of common contacts and the final clusters are analysed using the best model generated as a reference (the `caprieval` module).  Detailed explanations on how to configure a workflow through the configuration files can be found <a href=""https://github.com/haddocking/haddock3/blob/main/docs/tutorials/user_config.rst"">here</a>.  Having the configuration file ready, users can run HADDOCK3 with a single command-line input:  ```bash haddock3 config-file.cfg ```  You can find examples of HADDOCK3 workflows for the different biological systems in the `examples` [subfolder][examples] of the HADDOCK3 folder.  HADDOCK3 will start running (different execution modes are available using either local resources (threads) or in ""batch"" mode using a batch queuing system) - for details, see [here][queue]. See examples in the `examples` [subfolder][examples] for configuration files ending in `-full.cfg`.  Finally, HADDOCK3 has several advanced features that allow users additional flexibility in creating, restarting and extending runs, for example. Please read about our advanced features [here][advanced].  Please continue exploring our documentation pages for more information and explanations on HADDOCK3.

At Voc, the highly directional beam of photons from the sun is absorbed and subsequently externally re-emitted into a 4π solid angle, providing a large photon entropy loss. A solar cell can beat the Shockley-Queisser limit and approach the 46.7% ultimate limit by decreasing the output solid angle of the light emission at open circuit conditions.  Here, we present a design for an InP single nanowire solar cell capable to operate 159 mV above the radiative limit. We first optimize the spontaneous emission factor (b-factor in the dataset) into a guided mode of the nanowire towards 68%. We subsequently launch a guided mode at the bottom straight part of the tapered nanowire yielding a photon escape probability of 81% for a tapering angle of θ=1.2 degrees                                                   and a top facet with a radius of 83 nm (transmission part of the dataset). When assuming homogeneous light emission along the nanowire, an outcoupling efficiency of 42% of the emitted light is obtained. The final optimization is the reduction of the emission cone towards 0.011 sr by focusing the guided mode with an external lens (lens part of the dataset).",,

The package takes a csv file as input and generates a defined number of matched sets for a given number of continuous and categorical variables. One of the categorical variables can be selected to be split absolutely even across sets. Discuit generates the following output: - csv file ammended with the set membership for each item - txt file that reports on the outcomes of statistics tests  In the future, this will be integrated in an GUI.   The project setup is documented in [project_setup.md](project_setup.md).  ## Installation  Discuit is available on PyPI!  ```bash pip install discuit ```  Or install the latest development version directly from GitHub:  ```console git clone git@github.com:doerte/discuit-project.git cd discuit-project python3 -m pip install . ```  <!-- ## Documentation  Include a link to your project's full documentation here. -->   ## Using Discuit In the terminal, run Discuit with the following command: python3 run_discuit.py ""name of input file"" [number of desired sets] --columns l/c/n/a/d --runs [desired number of runs]  Example: python3 discuit/run_discuit.py example/input.csv 2 --columns l a n c n d --runs 3  This will run Discuit with the [provided testfile](example/input.csv) and create 2 subsets. The columns in the file are identified as ""label"", ""categorical"", ""numerical"", ""absolute"", ""numerical"" and ""disregard"" (in that order). The program will run 3 times (and create 3 output files).  ### Required input The input file needs to be a .csv file with a first line containing headings followed by rows that represent the different items. Each column specifies one variable.   When launching the script, please specify per column what kind a data the script should expect:  - (l)abel: just a label, will not be taken into consideration, could be the itemname or itemnumber. This can only be assigned once.  - (n)umerical: a numerical variable, such as frequency or AoA,  - (c)ategorical: a categorical variable, such as ""transitivity"" or ""accuracy"",  - (a)bsolute: this needs to be perfectly divided between sets. This can only be assigned once.  - (d)isregard: a column that does not need to be taken into account for the split, but contains other information you have in the same file.  The package will try maximally 20 times to come-up with a good split. If it doesn't it will give up and output it's last try. You can always run it again. Often it will succeed eventually. If not, consider dropping variables.  If you run the script without specifying --columns, you will be asked what you want per column. If you don't specify the desired number of runs, it will generate 1 output file.  ### Missing data If you choose an ""absolute split variable"", this variable cannot have missing data. The program will exit if it does.  For categorical variables, a dummy category is created that holds the items with missing data. For numerical variables, missing data is replaced with the average of this variable. If you prefer a different approach, please prepare your input file in a way that does not include missing data.  ## Contributing  If you want to contribute to the development of Discuit, have a look at the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).  ## Credits  This package was created with [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) and the [NLeSC/python-template](https://github.com/NLeSC/python-template).",https://github.com/doerte/discuit-project,doerte/discuit-project

The model solves the tide-topography interactions that drive sandbank evolution. The initial topography is a small sandbank in a shallow sea&nbsp;that is unaffected by coastal boundaries and where the sand supply is limited by the presence of a non-erodible layer. The growth and migration of this sandbank are simulated until a morphodynamic equilibrium is reached. The inputs are topographic, tidal, and numerical parameters, which are fully described in the README file. The outputs are the evolution of the bank topography over time and whether and equilibrium bank shape is reached. The topography of the last time step is the equilibrium profile (if one is reached). Importantly, our model is idealised, which means that it is meant to understand the dynamics of sandbank equilibria rather than predicting how a specific sandbank in a complex field setting will evolve. Furthermore, our model simulates the evolution of the one-dimensional cross-sections. It does not simulate variations in the along-bank direction. A full description of our methodology can be found in our journal paper (doi: 10.1029/2023JF007308).&nbsp;",,

While quantitative models that reproduce the laboratory data on frictional slip on faults is the minimum necessary to simulate their mechanical behavior in nature, convincing models must ultimately also account for all key fault zone observations. Taking a fault in carbonate rock as an example, and using fundamental data on the microscale processes that lead to fault friction, this work takes a first step towards simulating the dynamic evolution and self-organization of internal fault zone (micro)structure, processes and properties during a seismic slip event. The results show that the model captures many key observations on seismic fault behaviour, paving the way for still further improvements in developing a physics-based understanding of earthquake rupture in future. The present dataset includes the raw codes of four cases that are implemented in the finite element model (FEM) package Comsol (version 3.5a), and the numerical data produced by the codes (Results I to IV).",,

The results show that by implementing controls such as: 1) different fracture levels, 2) hierarchical behaviour, 3) topological rules, and 4) a strict fracture spacing relationship, this algorithm is able to simulate the network geometries which show a close resemblance to their outcrop counterparts, especially with respect to simulations which only account for the statistical observations.

Geodisy changes that, giving you a window into the world of research data with map-based tools familiar to everyone. Search by place name, or by drawing a box. The world of research data is yours to discover. Geodisy is the software that will let you do just that. Who will use Geodisy?  **People** Anyone looking for research data who wants to use a map or a box to find data. Researchers, students, journalists, and anyone else with an interest in data from university research will benefit from Geodisy's search tools.  **Institutions** The first users of Geodisy will be FRDR, Canada's Federated Research Data Repository, for the quick and easy discovery of Canadian Research Data. When released, anyone with the available infrastructure will be able to plug in Geodisy and make a compatible repository more discoverable. Why use Geodisy?  Data, and in particular research data, has always been difficult to find. Keywords can be hit and miss, and text based descriptions don't show you where your place of interest lies. Geodisy changes that, showing you where, not just what.  If you're a running a research data repository based on Dataverse, Geodisy will take your repository's data, search for geospatial metadata and files, and copy them to a new system which allows for visual searching. Your original data and search methods are untouched; you have the benefit of both. How does Geodisy work?  Geodisy is a separate server software component that examines the metadata, such as the study records for research data and any associated data. If Geodisy finds spatial data, metadata and data are harvested, then normalized to have the same geospatial metadata standard. Afterwards, both data and metadata are injected into a geospatial data server and a viewer/search component.",https://github.com/ubc-library/geodisy,ubc-library/geodisy

It is a control algorithm that sacrifices some optimality (much less than tube MPC) but provides robust solutions (more about this can be found in [1]). The original controller presented in [1] proved to work and showed good performance, but solving the optimality problem took too long to implement it for a real robot. To solve this problem, we used a spiking neural network to approximate SDD-TMPC.  &nbsp;  First, we generated data using Matlab's main script. It is a function that takes a seed as input and randomly samples the state of the robot in an environment as it works. The environment is a circular environment with 1 meter radius and a wall around it. Then it tries to solve the optimization problem, i.e. find an optimal input such that a cost function is minimized, a robot does not collide with the wall, and the terminal constraints are satisfied. Once the optimization problem is solved, a new file is created, and the sampled data is saved with the additional data.  &nbsp;  It is possible that no solution was found. In such a case, a vector full of zeros will be saved. It is worth noting that it takes a lot of time to generate each data sample. According to our research, it is important to generate the data as close to the global optimum as possible, because outliers make training the network much more difficult. Therefore, we decided to spend a lot of time generating each data sample.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  All generated data were saved in two files ""final_data.csv"" and ""final_data.xlsx"". The former contains the state (only 2 columns, there is no saved direction because it is assumed that the coordinate frame is rotated so that the direction is always 0), optimal input (2 columns - linear and angular velocity), nominal input (2 columns - linear and angular velocity) and nominal error (3 columns - 2-dimensional position and direction). The nominal velocity and nominal error can be used to calculate the optimal input (see [2] for details), i.e. to check if there is no problem with the data. The file ""final_data.xlsx"" also contains an additional column with seeds to make the data reproducible.  &nbsp;  The next step is to use ""network_traning.ipynb"" to train the networks. After running this file, the files ""linear_final.pt"" and ""angular_final.pt"" are created. These files contain the trained spiking neural networks that can be used instead of SDD-TMPC. The ""network_tester.ipynb"" file is used to compare the behavior between SDD-TMPC and its approximation. After execution, figures are generated.  &nbsp;  Finally, to test the behavior of the system, we created a ROS2 package to control a wheeled robot.  &nbsp;",https://data.4tu.nl/v3/datasets/7cd3aa1b-4cf0-46c8-87a6-17190998dcd6.git,

In the current deep learning paradigm for automatic action recognition, it is imperative that models are trained and tested on datasets and tasks that evaluate if such models actually learn and reason over long-term information. In this work, we propose a method to evaluate how suitable a video dataset is to evaluate models for long-term action recognition. To this end, we define a long-term action as excluding all the videos that can be correctly recognized using solely short-term information. We test this definition on existing long-term classification tasks on three popular real-world datasets, namely Breakfast, CrossTask and LVU, to determine if these datasets are truly evaluating long-term recognition. Our method involves conducting user studies, where we ask humans to annotate videos from these datasets. Our study reveals that these datasets can be effectively solved using shortcuts based on short-term information. In this repository, we provide the code and data.

The TCRP model has as main aim to adjust  runoff patterns based on topography for tillage induced roughness. The resulting output of TCRP are runoff pattern raster maps, which can be further used as input  for hydrological modelling of surface runoff processes. The methodology to create the runoff pattern includes four steps. First, a topographically controlled runoff pattern is created using the standard single-flow, steepest descent algorithm. Next, a tillage-determined runoff pattern is created, i.e. a runoff pattern based on the assumption that water will always flow in the tillage direction. Then, decision rules are applied to determine for each cell whether the water will flow in tillage direction or in topographic direction. Finally, a flow direction map can be generated by combining the topographically determined runoff pattern with the tillage-controlled runoff pattern. This repository is an updated version of the original code, adjusted to run smoothly with the current version of PCRaster (v4.4.0)",,

The platform facilitates a ""Great Bake Off"" of computational workflows in bioinformatics by integrating bioinformatics tools and metadata with technologies for automated workflow exploration and benchmarking. This enables a systematic and rigorous approach to the development of cutting-edge workflows, specifically in the field of proteomics, to increase scientific quality, robustness, reproducibility, FAIRness, and maintainability.  The platform currently focuses on the proteomics domain.

68af674d-8532-4ad8-9231-d62f3856f15a,4tu-lap-orbit-maintenance,lap_orbit_maintenance,"This thesis investigates the feasibility of the usage of space-based Laser Ablation Propulsion (LAP) to perform orbit maintenance on CubeSat in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). The thesis is motivated by the growing need for efficient, compact propulsion systems for small satellites and explores LAP as a method that eliminates the need for onboard fuel by generating momentum via directed laser beams from orbital laser stations.  A detailed simulation framework is developed to model the physical environment in LEO, including atmospheric drag, solar radiation pressure, and third-body gravitational effects. The propagation of high-powered lasers through space is modeled considering diffraction, absorption, and current limits of aiming precision. The propulsion interaction between laser and CubeSat is simulated through a dynamic model based on material properties and laser beam parameters.  Power generation and energy storage are analyzed in the context of space-based constraints, comparing solar arrays, battery technologies, and their degradation over time. A financial model evaluates system-level trade-offs, including station cost, maintenance intervals, and replacement economics. Optimizations are performed to understand how propulsion efficiency, energy storage capacity, and environmental variability affect system performance and scalability.  Simulation results show that LAP is viable under current technological constraints, provided stations are deployed in sufficient numbers and at the right altitudes. The system can service a meaningful number of CubeSats while remaining competitive with the cost of satellite replacement. Technological limitations such as aiming accuracy and beam control are identified as key challenges, with recommendations for future work including the expansion of in-orbit LAP to networks, and further  applications.",https://data.4tu.nl/v3/datasets/784443cf-d65e-43d8-8cfc-0614e274c7cc.git,

6c5e8ad3-f28f-4a4a-8770-efedfd9cdb86,obiba-opal,OBiBa Opal,"# What is Opal?  Opal is OBiBa's core data managment application. This server application provides all the necessary tools to import, transform and describe data. Subject’s identifiers can also be managed at data import and export time.  ## Analysis Thanks to its integration with R , complex statistical analysis and reports can be performed. The implementation of the DataSHIELD process allows advanced statistical data analysis across multiple studies without sharing and disclosing any individual-level data.  ## Integration Being integrated with Onyx and Mica, studies using Opal can seamlessly and securely import data collected with Onyx. They can also create web data portals with Mica that query Opal databases to obtain real-time aggregated reports on subject's data.  Secured REST web services are also available allowing to automate server management (Python command line tools) or to access to data (from R or any tools that are web-capable).  # Features ## Data Warehouse Here are some of the main features of the Opal’s data warehouse technologies:  * Store data on an unlimited number of variables, * Support MongoDB , Mysql , MariaDB and PostgreSQL as database software backend, * Customized variable dictionaries, * Import data from CSV, SPSS, SAS, Stata files and from SQL databases, * Export data to CSV, SPSS, SAS, Stata files and to SQL databases, * Incremental data importation, * Connect directly to multiple data source software such as SQL databases and LimeSurvey , * Store data about any type of ""entity"", such as subject, sample, geographic area, etc., * Store data of any type (e.g., texts, numbers, geo-localisation, images, videos, etc.), * Import and store genotype data as VCF files (Variant Call format ), * Advanced indexing functionality using ElasticSearch , * SQL API for selecting, filtering, grouping, joining table's data.  ## Resources  Resources are datasets or computation units which location is described by a URL and access is protected by credentials. When assigned to a R/DataSHIELD server session, remote big/complex datasets or high performance computers are made accessible to data analysts. Opal provides an interface for managing the access to the resources and assigning them to a R/DataSHIELD server session, in integration with the resourcer R package. When using resources, the Opal installation is very light-weight as no database and no import process is required: the data are accessed where they are originaly located, from the R server.  ## Views and Derived Variables  Opal provides the software infrastructure to create virtual tables called ""views"" of derived variables that can be persisted on disk or exported into files. Main features are: * Comprehensive JavaScript library of util functions commonly used to derive new variables (e.g. unit conversion) See Magma Javascript API . * User-friendly interfaces to recode variables without programming, * Instant summary statistics computation of the new derived variables.  ## Privacy, Confidentiality and Security Opal provides a state-of-the-art software infrastructure for data encryption, participant identifiers management and user authentication/authorization. Main features are: * Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) allowing Opal to manage public-private key pairs for encrypting and decrypting data, * Authentication using either certificates, username/password or token mechanisms, * Integration with any OpenID Connect providers, * Advanced participant identifiers manager enabling multiple identifiers per participant, * Distinct and highly secure database for storing participant identifiers, * Granular permission management down to the variable level, * REST web services using HTTPS protocol.  ## Opal File System Studies's operations involve file management and exchanges. Opal comes with its own file system to facilitate these processes. Main features are: * Centralized and file management, * SFTP access.  ## Genotypes Genotyping data can be stored in Opal as VCF files (Variant Call format ).

The problem consists in the definition of the subnetworks of a dynamical system that can be considered as individual control agents in the distributed control approach. Despite its relevance and the different approaches proposed in the literature, no generalized technique to perform the partitioning of a network of dynamical systems is present yet. In this article, we introduce a general approach to partitioning for distributed control. This approach is composed by an algorithmic part selecting elementary subnetworks, and by an integer program, which aggregates the elementary components according to a global index. We empirically evaluated our approach on a distributed predictive control problem in the context of power systems, obtaining promising performances in terms of reduction of computation speed and resource cost, while retaining a good level of performance.",https://data.4tu.nl/v3/datasets/502016d0-e852-4176-8a7e-0e4d8b350440.git,

Scope graphs provide a way to type-check real-world programming languages and their constructs. Previous implementations that type-check LM, a language with relative, unordered, and glob imports, do not halt. This dataset contains Haskell code for constructing and type-checking a scope graph of an LM program. It is based on the Phased Haskell library. With this implementation, the all test cases halt and the majority exhibit the correct behaviour with only one false-negative.

6f5ba5d1-0232-4abb-b657-cc33d12a98b0,ricgraph,Ricgraph - Research in context graph,"## What is Ricgraph?  Ricgraph, also known as Research in context graph, enables the exploration of researchers, teams, their results, collaborations, skills, projects, and the relations between these items.  Ricgraph can store many types of items into a single graph.  These items can be obtained from various systems and from multiple organizations. Ricgraph facilitates reasoning about these items because it infers new relations between items, relations that are not present in any of the separate source systems.  Ricgraph is flexible and extensible, and can be adapted to new application areas.  Throughout this text, we illustrate how Ricgraph works by applying it to the application area research information.   ### Motivation  Ricgraph, also known as Research in context graph, is software that is about relations between items. These items can be collected from various source systems and from multiple organizations. We explain how Ricgraph works by applying it to the application area *research information*. We show the insights that can be obtained by combining information from various source systems, insight arising from new relations that are not present in each separate source system.  *Research information* is about anything related to research: research results, the persons in a research team, their collaborations, their skills, projects in which they have participated, as well as the relations between these entities.  Examples of *research results* are publications, data sets, and software.  Example use cases from the application area research information are: * As a journalist, I want to find researchers with a certain skill and their publications, so that I can interview them for a newspaper article. * As a librarian, I want to enrich my local research information system with research results that are in other systems but not in ours, so that we have a more complete view of research at our university. * As a researcher, I want to find researchers from other universities that have co-authored publications written by the co-authors of my own publications, so that I can read their publications to find out if we share common research interests.  These use cases use different types of information (called *items*): researchers, skills, publications, etc. Most often, these types of information are not stored in one system, so the use cases may be difficult or time-consuming to answer. However, by using Ricgraph, these use cases (and many others) are easy to answer.  Although this text illustrates Ricgraph in the application area research information, the principle “relations between items from various source systems” is general, so Ricgraph can be used in other application areas.  ### Main contributions of Ricgraph  * Ricgraph can store many types of items in a single graph. * Ricgraph harvests multiple source systems into a single graph. * Ricgraph Explorer is the exploration tool for Ricgraph. * Ricgraph facilitates reasoning about items because it infers new relations between items. * Ricgraph can be tailored for an application area.  ### Read more about Ricgraph  For a gentle introduction in Ricgraph, read the reference publication: Rik D.T.

Islandora is an extensible, modular, open source digital repository ecosystem focused on collaborative authorship, management, display, and preservation of digital content at scale. Islandora adheres to widely adopted best practices and open standards. ‍ Islandora is a community-developed project, rather than a singular entity’s vision of what a digital repository system should be. As such, functionality is created by individuals, institutions, service providers and consortia and shared back with the community.  The community pulls together in Community Sprints that complete tasks of universal interest and build consensus on issues of architecture and feature development. Islandora is maintained by the community and through targeted service and contractor arrangements funded by community membership in the Foundation. ‍  Core functions of Islandora allow you to: * Create, manage, and display collections or other compound configurations of any type of file: Images, documents (including PDFs), described audio/video, books/newspapers (and other paged content), and arbitrary file formats (binary files). * Display and view any file supported in modern browser technology, with integrations for the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) for images, and native integration with Drupal’s rich ecosystem of modules for digital exhibit creation. * Transcode source files for preservation, display, and full text indexing via an optional suite of microservices that enable the system to scale and manage complex media workflows, as well as to move and transform content.  * Preserve content through integration with common standards for persistent identifiers (such as DOI, ARK and Handle), fixity checking, bag-it compliant bags (Archival Information Packages) creation, PRONOM registry linking, reporting for content health. content versioning support, and the creation of robust administrative metadata.  * Create, serialize, export, and expose metadata in any format, with out-of-the box support for a robust MODS use case. In Islandora’s current iteration, we have replaced Islandora Legacy (Islandora 7s) form builder with a tighter integration with Drupal's extensive content management system, allowing for better, and more user-friendly manipulation of metadata entry forms and both the transformation and publication of metadata.  * Utilize world-class, highly configurable research index with faceting, simple search, faceted search, browse functions, and the ability to expose metadata through both OAI-PMH and Sparql endpoints. * Secure content through Drupal’s authentication layer, which facilitates the authoring of roles and permissions at multiple layers. Content may be kept dark and exposed to various target groups, and unique workflows can be authored to suit your institution, including the ability to set embargos (often used for institutional repositories).   Islandora “core” is comprised of the following Open Source technologies, installation of which has been automated through the ISLE-DC, ISLE-BUILDKIT (Docker), and ISLANDORA-PLAYBOOK (Ansible) projects: * Drupal * Apache Solr and ActiveMQ * Cantaloupe, a IIIF-compliant media server * Mirador, a IIIF-compliant media viewer * Matomo * ImageMagick * FFmpeg * Tesseract OCR * FITS * Fedora (optional)  Out of the box, Islandora includes content model support for:  * Collections, the basic containers into which other Repository Items may be organized * A variety of Images, from simple JPEGs to archival TIFFs  * PDF-based “Digital Documents” * Audio files in a variety of formats * Video files in a variety of formats * Books, comprised of Pages which may be either Images or PDFs * Newspapers (periodical series of Newspaper Issues, which are comprised of Pages which may be either Images or PDFs) * Binary Objects, which allow arbitrary attachments for which there are often not web viewers * Compound Objects, which are a special type of Collection which presents like a Digital Exhibition and may also be used as a secondary organization mechanism  Through extension of these content models, Islandora allows for modeling, storage and display of a wide variety of specialized content, including Theses and Dissertations, Journal Articles, High-quality archival media, and Research Data.  Please review our full documentation for additional details about Islandora.  # Migration and Adoption There are a variety of mechanisms for exporting content from Islandora 7 and other repository systems and importing it into the current release of Islandora, with Islandora Workbench being the most widely used and best documented. The Islandora Roadmap emphasizes the creation of migration documentation and support in Q2, 2022.  #What's next? The Islandora Leadership Group maintains a roadmap of anticipated additions to the Islandora ecosystem, both from projects known to be ongoing at community institutions as well as the result of community sprints. This document may be viewed here.  #How do I get involved? Just getting started in Islandora? Join one of our communication channels, review our community wiki (especially the onboarding checklist).

This study presents a multistage PINN approach designed to efficiently solve coupled multiphysics systems with strong interdependencies. The multistage PINN progressively increases the complexity of the physical system being modeled, enabling more effective capture of coupling between different physics. The computational merits of this approach are demonstrated through two illustrative applications: prediction of asphalt aging and modeling of lid-driven cavity flow. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons with standard PINN and adaptive weight PINN approaches demonstrate the enhanced precision and computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm. The multistage PINN achieves a reduction in training time of more than 90% compared to standard PINNs while maintaining better alignment with the finite element method (FEM) solutions. The improvement in computational efficiency, coupled with enhanced accuracy, positions the multistage PINN as a powerful tool for addressing complex multiphysics problems across various engineering disciplines. The method’s ability to handle interactions between multiple physical processes, such as diffusion, chemical reactions, and fluid dynamics, makes it suitable for simulating long-term material behavior and complex fluid system.",https://data.4tu.nl/v3/datasets/8cdb120a-f4cb-47eb-98b3-aac6fbea1d75.git,

We argue that these models are not always the best choice for temporal modeling in videos. A large temporal receptive field allows the model to encode the exact sub-action order of a video, which causes a performance decrease when testing videos have a different sub-action order. In this work, we investigate whether we can improve the model robustness to the sub-action order by shrinking the temporal receptive field of action recognition models. For this, we design Video BagNet, a variant of the 3D ResNet-50 model with the temporal receptive field size limited to 1, 9, 17 or 33 frames. We analyze Video Bag-Net on synthetic and real-world video datasets and experimentally compare models with varying temporal receptive fields. We find that short receptive fields are robust to sub-action order changes, while larger temporal receptive fields are sensitive to the sub-action order.

Abstract  In this paper we show how Group Equivariant Convolutional Neural Networks use subsampling to learn to break equivariance to their symmetries. We focus on 2D rotations and reflections and investigate the impact of broken equivariance on network performance. We show that a change in the input dimension of a network as small as a single pixel can be enough for commonly used architectures to become approximately equivariant, rather than exactly. We investigate the impact of networks not being exactly equivariant and find that approximately equivariant networks generalise significantly worse to unseen symmetries compared to their exactly equivariant counterparts. However, when the symmetries in the training data are not identical to the symmetries of the network, we find that approximately equivariant networks are able to relax their own equivariant constraints, causing them to match or outperform exactly equivariant networks on common benchmark datasets.",https://data.4tu.nl/v3/datasets/9fd566e4-f4a8-4585-b705-be66fc29af9b.git,

A major challenge is that we don’t have the information to know ahead of time which treatments will work and which won't. This is why we have ICGC ARGO.   The ARGO project is a new phase of the International Cancer Genome Consortium. Launched in 2019 after 10 successful years of the ICGC mapping genomic alterations that characterise over 50 cancer types.  The time has now come to translate this knowledge to improve outcomes for people affected by cancer. Mission  ICGC ARGO will uniformly analyze specimens from 100,000 cancer patients with high quality clinical data to address outstanding questions that are vital to our quest to defeat cancer.   Over the next ten years ICGC ARGO aims to deliver a million patient-years of precision oncology knowledge to the world, by making data available to the entire research community in a rapid and responsible way, to accelerate research into the causes and control of cancer.   **The ARGO project aims to address the following questions:**      How do we use current treatments better?     How does a cancer change with time and treatment?     How do we practically implement these approaches in healthcare and drug development?     How do we advance early detection and ultimately prevent cancer?  # Background  Research shows that each cancer is different, yet we treat them much the same. A major challenge is that we don’t have the information to know ahead of time which treatments will work and which won't. This means that frequently clinicians either overtreat or undertreat cancers, or there is no meaningful treatment at all.   This is important as cancer incidence and deaths are rising worldwide as a result of the growth and aging of the human population. There were 17 million new cases of cancer (all cancers combined excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) worldwide in 2018 and it is predicted there will be 27.5 million new cancer cases worldwide each year by 2040; an increase of 61.7% from 2018, if recent trends in incidence of major cancers and population growth continue globally.   The ability to rapidly generate massive ‘omics datasets has driven a new era in the world of medicine which promises to optimally manage disease, leading to improvements in outcomes for patients and efficiencies in healthcare systems. This is known as “Precision Medicine”. Precision medicine aims to match each patient with the treatment that will work best for them and their genome provide individualised care, and better address those questions every cancer patient deserves an answer to, such as “which treatment will be most effective for me and what will be the likely outcome”.   Numerous platforms for various cancer types have been established to address these vital questions in many countries around the world. Whilst these build on our knowledge base, there are currently no mechanisms to standardise the complex analyses, or efficient mechanisms for data sharing for cancer that will enable composite and pooled analyses of data from around the world. Based on the 10-year ICGC experience, ARGO stands poised to accelerate cancer research for the international community through its established infrastructure, expertise and workflows.   **The project size and scope will enable:**      An understanding of the regional differences in disease around the world.      The heterogeneity of cancer.     The diversity of environmental risk factors.      Describe new cancers with a common genomic background, and common outcomes; and the many different combinations of therapeutic interventions.",https://github.com/icgc-argo,

Using HashiCorp's Terraform technology, the program provides scripts to define and launch a server on Amazon's AWS infrastructure. Specifically, it uses the AWS modules SQS (message queueing), Lambda (code), S3 (storage), and Kinesis Data Firehose (data transfer) to set up a pipeline that facilitates scraping pages from the IA. An AWS account is required to deploy the pipeline.  Once deployed, the pipeline can be fed a list of domains. The software obtains all available URLs in the IA for each of those domains. As the IA can store multiple snapshots of the same URL, a time period can be configured within which all available snapshots of a URL will be saved. The resulting list of URLs is passed on to a second function, that retrieves the corresponding pages from the IA. For each page, the human readable text and, optionally, all links in the page are saved to a database. The database consists of Apache Parquet files saved in an S3 bucket. Afterwards, the Parquet files can be downloaded manually and be read out for analysis in R, Python or other compatible programs.",https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/ia-webscraping,UtrechtUniversity/ia-webscraping

This is due to the fact that individual software packages are designed to do a task and to do that task well; they are not primarily designed to interact with other, complementary packages.

These components are based on existing tools. Users can easily construct new analysis workflows by combining these pre-baked components with tools of their own creation.

While their elastic mechanical properties have been systematically determined, their large-deformation, nonlinear responses have been challenging to predict and design, in part due to limited data sets and the need for complex nonlinear simulations. This work presents a novel physics-enhanced machine learning (ML) and optimization framework tailored to address the challenges of designing intricate spinodal metamaterials with customized mechanical properties in large-deformation scenarios where computational modeling is restrictive and experimental data is sparse. By utilizing large-deformation experimental data directly, this approach facilitates the inverse design of spinodal structures with precise finite-strain mechanical responses. The framework sheds light on instability-induced pattern formation in spinodal metamaterials—observed experimentally and in selected nonlinear simulations—leveraging physics-based inductive biases in the form of nonconvex energetic potentials. Altogether, this combined ML, experimental, and computational effort provides a route for efficient and accurate design of complex spinodal metamaterials for large-deformation scenarios where energy absorption and prediction of nonlinear failure mechanisms is essential.",https://data.4tu.nl/v3/datasets/335d3b61-a83a-4c28-8a2f-0e622ac3ac0e.git,

Non-controlled settings provide researchers with an opportunity to study real-world and long-term health outcomes.  The use of data generated through wearable devices, mobile devices, or online collection of patient-reported experiences and outcomes, presents numerous data management challenges.

The Virtual Health Gateway is a platform that facilitates direct, consistent, and standardized capture of diverse data types from research study participants in real- world settings. The solution builds on previous CANARIE-funded work (Researcher Portal for Secure Data Discovery, Access, and Collaboration) which enables researchers to collect, manage, analyze, and share their study data by introducing participant engagement tools, processes, and interfaces.   Once integrated, the Virtual Health Gateway will not only allow participant information and data to be shared with researchers and clinicians, but also with study participants and caregivers.

The emphasis is on (near) conservation laws and on shock-dominated problems in particular. A number of physics modules are included; the hydrodynamics and the magnetohydrodynamics module are most frequently used. Users can add their own physics module or modify existing ones. The framework supports 1D to 3D simulations, in a number of different geometries (Cartesian, cylindrical, spherical).  MPI-AMRVAC is written in Fortran 90 and uses MPI for parallelization. The VACPP preprocessor is used to extend Fortran with dimensional independent notation, but users are not required to learn the VACPP syntax.  The philosophy behind MPI-AMRVAC is to use a single versatile code with options and switches for various problems. The advantage of such a general approach is easier maintenance, the compatibility of different parts, and the automatic extension of new features to existing applications. MPI-AMRVAC is not a fool-proof black-box design. A user needs to write subroutines for initial conditions, and for source terms or special boundary conditions when needed.

To address this issue, a safety preserving controller is presented. The proposed controller is based on topology-switching coalitional MPC, which utilises a RUIO to detect and isolate the cyber-attacks. Attacked communication links are then disabled to accommodate the attack. Furthermore, the MPC controller is designed to be resilient against undetected attacks and the uncertainty derived from disabling communication links.

888bc2dc-a012-450e-a8e0-3ac7a7c6dc7b,cbrain,CBRAIN,"# Description  CBRAIN is a web-enabled grid platform that facilitates collaborative research on large, distributed data by creating an interface between a user (or a group of collaborating users) and high-performance computing centres (HPCs). Behind the web-portal, CBRAIN manages data access, transfer, caching and provenance, as well as data processing and reporting. CBRAIN is generic and modular, it can easily be extended with new data models and tools for a broad range of research disciplines.  ## It has several important capabilities:  * Files may be be stored anywhere: on local servers or on remote servers. * Files are moved automatically and upon demand (e.g. by user or a task), without interfering with platform components and without the user having to worry too much about their actual location. * Tasks can be launched at any scale: on local servers or on powerful compute clusters. CBRAIN supports clusters running Sun Grid Engine (SGE), MOAB, Torque/PBS, or simple UNIX processes, transparently. Other adapters are easy to implement. * Files can be displayed or accessed on the web interface according to their own internal representation. For example a JPEG file can be viewed, or an MRI file can be parsed slice-by-slice on the web interface. * Files and tasks are deployed as plugins, so a CBRAIN administrator can write his own or simply import them from other developers.  ## Where does it come from?  The CBRAIN service was originally conceived through a CANARIE grant awarded to Professor Alan C. Evans, at McGill University. The resulting internal code platform was meant to provide easy access to complex neuroimaging computational tools, for clinicians or neuroscience researchers with limited IT resources. Despite the name, the framework is designed to be general, and can accommodate any data and task for any application. This GIT repository contains the generic core of the framework, which is not specific to any field of science. Who should use CBRAIN?  Any research group that depends on medium to large-scale computational data analysis, can benefit from CBRAIN's data and task management back engine. CBRAIN provides tools for archiving raw and processed data files, viewing them, and processing then in batch. For example, an astronomy researcher's lab could deploy CBRAIN and configure its data servers for storage of its instrument's acquisitions, and to launch its in-house data processing/analysis software on some preconfigured supercomputer cluster.",https://github.com/aces/cbrain,aces/cbrain

The repeatability package includes experiments of abstracting different types of stochastic systems (additive linear/affine, polynomial, neural network dynamic models, Gaussian processes, and stochastically switched systems) to Interval Markov Decision Processes (IMDPs), orthogonally decoupled IMDPs (odIMDPs), and mixtures of odIMDPs. odIMDPs are a new abstract model proposed in the paper, where the ambiguity sets of transition probabilities are specified as products of (marginal) interval ambiguity sets.

Routines are provided to CMOR-ize non-compliant data in-memory.  The ESMValCore software package provides the core functionality for ESMValTool, the Earth System Model eValuation Tool. It provides a configurable framework for finding CMIP files using a “data reference syntax”, applying commonly used pre-processing functions to them, running analysis scripts, and recording provenance. Numerous pre-processing functions, e.g. for data selection, regridding, and statistics are readily available and the modular design makes it easy to add more. The ESMValCore package is easy to install with relatively few dependencies, written in Python 3, based on state-of-the-art open-source libraries such as Iris and Dask, and widely used standards such as YAML, NetCDF, CF-Conventions, and W3C PROV. An extensive set of automated tests and code quality checks ensure the reliability of the package.  The ESMValCore package uses human-readable recipes to define which variables and datasets to use, how to pre-process that data, and what scientific analysis scripts to run. The package provides convenient interfaces, based on the YAML and NetCDF/CF-convention file formats, for running diagnostic scripts written in any programming language. Because the ESMValCore framework takes care of running the workflow defined in the recipe in parallel, most analyses run much faster, with no additional programming effort required from the authors of the analysis scripts. For example, benchmarks show a factor of 30 speedup with respect to version 1 of the tool for a representative recipe on a 24 core machine. A large collection of standard recipes and associated analysis scripts is available in the ESMValTool package for reproducing selected peer-reviewed analyses.",https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValCore,ESMValGroup/ESMValCore

ONC's data are very dynamic due to continually accumulating data streams, data reprocessing, and data product code versioning. While there has been a growing recognition of the need for and benefits of data citations, as evidenced by the reception of the FAIR Principles, existing platforms and tools such as Dataverse and the Federated Research Data Repository (FRDR) are currently only able to serve the needs of static, or infrequently updated, datasets. At ONC, we have an opportunity to go further, building the infrastructure within our repository to implement the 14 recommendations laid out by the RDA Working Group on Dynamic Data Citation.  MINTED allows data users to cite data in the repository from the beginning of a deployment, providing traceability of the dataset life cycle so that users can better interpret data integrity, respect the terms and conditions under which the data are made available, and increase the credibility of users. Data citation also allows users to link datasets to publication DOIs, contributor ORCIDs or RORs, funder reference IDs, ARK IDs, and more.   It makes strides in enabling reproducibility, provides curated datasets to end users, provides credit for publishing and providing data, helps repositories and users to track metrics of data usage and impact, and enhances metadata catalogues and products for citation content. Additionally, data citation stimulates related research as published datasets that have been cited lend themselves more readily to further analysis.   Lastly, the MINTED project also allows ONC to renew our certification with World Data System (WDS) CoreTrustSeal (CTS), identifying ONC as a repository that has implemented and supports FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles and best practices, encouraging confidence in the content within.   With the MINTED Project, Ocean Networks Canada is proud to be leading the way in implementing the RDA Recommendations on a large scale.

912f6e2f-a8f4-42e6-b4f1-1347486857a5,multilayergraphs,MultilayerGraphs.jl,"# MultilayerGraphs.jl   **MultilayerGraphs.jl** is a Julia package for the creation, manipulation and analysis of the structure, dynamics and functions of multilayer graphs.   ## Overview  A multilayer graph is a graph consisting of multiple standard subgraphs called *layers* which can be interconnected through [bipartite graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph) called *interlayers* composed of the vertex sets of two different layers and the edges between them. The vertices in each layer represent a single set of nodes, although not all nodes have to be represented in every layer.   Formally, a multilayer graph can be defined as a triple $G=(V,E,L)$, where:  - $V$ is the set of vertices; - $E$ is the set of edges, pairs of nodes $(u, v)$ representing a connection, relationship or interaction between the nodes $u$ and $v$; - $L$ is a set of layers, which are subsets of $V$ and $E$ encoding the nodes and edges within each layer.  Each layer $\ell$ in $L$ is a tuple $(V_\ell, E_\ell)$, where $V_\ell$ is a subset of $V$ that represents the vertices within that layer, and $E_\ell$ is a subset of $E$ that represents the edges within that layer.  Multiple theoretical frameworks have been proposed to formally subsume all instances of multilayer graphs ([De Domenico  et al. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevx.3.041022); [Kivelä et al. (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1093/comnet/cnu016); [Boccaletti et al. (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physrep.2014.07.001); [Lee et al.

Multilayer graphs have been adopted to model the structure and dynamics of a wide spectrum of high-dimensional, non-linear, multi-scale, time-dependent complex systems including physical, chemical, biological, neuronal, socio-technical, epidemiological, ecological and economic networks ([Cozzo et al. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1103/physreve.88.050801); [Granell et al.

MultilayerGraphs.jl is an integral part of the [JuliaGraphs](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs) ecosystem extending [Graphs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/Graphs.jl) so all the methods and metrics exported by Graphs.jl work for multilayer graphs, but due to the special nature of multilayer graphs the package features a peculiar implementation that maps a standard integer-labelled vertex representation to a more user-friendly framework exporting all the objects an experienced practitioner would expect such as nodes (`Node`), vertices (`MultilayerVertex`), layers (`Layer`), interlayers (`Interlayer`), etc.  MultilayerGraphs.jl features multilayer-specific methods and metrics including the global clustering coefficient, the overlay clustering coefficient, the multilayer eigenvector centrality, the multilayer modularity and the Von Neumann entropy.  Finally, MultilayerGraphs.jl has been integrated within the [JuliaDynamics](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics) ecosystem so that any `Multilayer(Di)Graph` can be utilised as an argument to the `GraphSpace` constructor in [Agents.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/Agents.jl).   ## Installation  To install MultilayerGraphs.jl it is sufficient to activate the `pkg` mode by pressing `]` in the Julia REPL and then run the following command:  ```nothing pkg> add MultilayerGraphs ```  ## How to Contribute   The ongoing development of this package would greatly benefit from the valuable feedback of the esteemed members of the [JuliaGraph](https://github.com/orgs/JuliaGraphs/people) community, as well as from graph theorists, network scientists, and any users who may have general questions or suggestions.   We therefore encourage you to participate in [discussions](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/MultilayerGraphs.jl/discussions), raise [issues](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/MultilayerGraphs.jl/issues), or submit [pull requests](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/MultilayerGraphs.jl/pulls).

To this end it performs a full-exhaustive 6-dimensional cross-correlation search between the atomic structure and the density. It takes as input an atomic structure in PDB-format and a cryo-EM density with its resolution; and outputs positions and rotations of the atomic structure corresponding to high correlation values. PowerFit uses the local cross-correlation function as its base score. The score can optionally be enhanced by a Laplace pre-filter and/or a core-weighted version to minimize overlapping densities from neighboring subunits. It can further be hardware-accelerated by leveraging multi-core CPU machines out of the box or by GPU via the OpenCL framework.

It enables eligible legal entities (organizations or individuals) to issue digital credentials which can later be verified by any interested party.  These credentials can relate to individuals in a decentralized digital identity system, but could equally be used to prove the authenticity of digital media or other digital artefacts.  When used for identity, the system avoids many of the problems typically associated with centralized digital identity systems. Users remain in control of their data at all times and share it selectively. There is no central data collection or storage, and no user registration necessary. By taking advantage of robust decentralized infrastructure, the system can be deployed at extremely low cost without compromising on security or resilience.  There are many possible use cases that Trustchain could support, but two examples are:    - Qualified medical practitioners moving between hospitals could verifiably prove their medical registration status.   - Workers in any industry could prove their educational or professional qualifications, or their right to work in a given jurisdiction.  Aside from individual identity, Trustchain also enables ""credentials for data"". Use cases here include certification of digital media (videos, photos, text) released by online publishers or journalists, or verifiable provenance of any published datasets such as AI models or training data.",https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/trustchain,alan-turing-institute/trustchain

9719beee-7fe0-45ee-8a80-aa5f53a9b605,motus-wildlife-tracking-system,Motus Wildlife Tracking System,"# About Motus When tracking wildlife with automated radio telemetry over vast distances, the challenge of deploying enough receivers to get detections grows exponentially. To remedy this, data can be shared between all researchers so that essentially everyone is sharing receivers. This greatly expands the potential for this technology, but it comes with the added responsibility of coordinating projects, detection data and metadata – that’s where Motus comes in.  # What is Motus? The Motus Wildlife Tracking System is an international collaborative network of researchers that use automated radio telemetry to simultaneously track hundreds of individuals of numerous species of birds, bats, and insects. The system enables a community of researchers, educators, organizations, and citizens to undertake impactful research and education on the ecology and conservation of migratory animals. When compared to other technologies, automated radio telemetry currently allows researchers to track the smallest animals possible, with high temporal and geographic precision, over great distances.  # How does Motus work? The philosophy behind Motus is that we’re all working together. At its core, Motus is community science. A community of researchers around the world conducting research on animals that are tracked by a network of coordinated receiving stations. These stations are maintained by a community of researchers, organizations, non-profits, governments, and individuals. In order for this concept to work, the system requires a centralized database and management system that all participants use. Most importantly, in order for your tags to be detected on any other station in the network, or for other project tags to be detected elsewhere, projects, receivers and tags need to be registered with, and have data processed by Motus. While any automated telemetry project can operate in isolation, operating as a Motus project combines the collective impact of local, regional, and even hemispheric projects into one massive collaborative effort that expands the scale and scope of everyone’s work and maximizes the use of scarce research dollars. It also makes data available and more useful for future projects, collaborative endeavors and large-scale meta analyses.  # What’s the cost? There is NO cost to register your project and receivers to the Motus network, contribute data from those receivers, and use the resources on the website. In order for transmitters to be detected by the network, they must be reregistered with Motus and are charged a nominal fee to support data processing and ongoing maintenance and development of the research software platform. See the [collaboration policy](https://motus.org/policy/) and fee schedule for more information.  # Services **Motus Client Data API:** This hosted web Application Programming Interface (API) is linked to the central Motus database, which serves as a backbone for much of the proposed data access and data visualizations functionalities for the hosted web platform, and can also be accessed by third party applications including the Motus R package. [Link](https://motus.org/canarie-api/client-api/service/info)  **Motus R Packages:** This service handles data access, processing, summary and analysis through dedicated R packages operated by Motus users. [Link](https://motuswts.github.io/motus/)  **Motus SensorGnome Software:** This service handles sensor operations, data collection and scheduling, and connectivity through a web interface hosted on the SensorGnome sensor, which is used by the Motus Wildlife Tracking System. Its main purpose is to detect radio signals from encoded tags attached to small animals, store and transmit the information to the main Motus database. [Link](https://docs.motus.org/sensorgnome/)  **Motus Server Data API:** This hosted service is used for internal communications between Motus servers (e.g. metadata registrations, internal data transfers). This API can also be used by equipment manufacturers collaborating with Motus (e.g. register tags or receivers metadata). [Link](https://motus.org/canarie-api/server-api/service/info)  **Motus Visualization API:** The Motus Wildlife Tracking System (Motus) is a novel automated radio-telemetry system for tracking the local, regional and continental movements of animals such as birds, bats and insects. This hosted web service provides an access point to a variety of data outputs (and formats, such as JavaScript code, html outputs, multimedia files).  # Data Ownership/Privacy The collaborative nature of Motus relies on a certain level of transparency with respect to data. While basic project and tag summary information is made publicly available, researchers have the ability to customize data accessibility and keep their project and data private if necessary. See the [collaboration policy](https://motus.org/policy/) for more information.",https://github.com/MotusWTS/motus,MotusWTS/motus

An experimental setup was developed to collect data on pressure drop, flow rate, bulk fluid temperature, and solid surface temperature. Six samples were tested, each fabricated with varying fiber diameters and inter-fiber spacings, covering a range of void fractions and surface areas. The overlall dimensions of the samples  were 16.1 x 16.1 x 6.2 mm^3. Pressure drop experiments were conducted for each sample at three distinct temperatures, approximately 7 °C, 22 °C, and 50 °C. For each temperature, the flow rate ranged from values above 2 Lpm to below 0.4 Lpm. Heat transfer experiments were performed by self-heating the samples using electrical current to create a temperature difference with the water stream. The temperatures of the 4 surfaces of the blocks parallel to the flow direction were recorded, and a heat transfer model was used to derive heat transfer coefficients.

In the EEA-ENB we consider the Load Frequency Control (LFC) problem in the presence of renewable energy sources (RESs), and energy storage systems (ESSs). RESs are known to cause instability in power networks due to their inertia-less and intermittent characteristics, while ESSs are introduced as a resource to mitigate the problem. In the EEA-ENB, particular attention is dedicated to Distributed Model Predictive Control (DMPC), whose application is often limited to small and homogeneous test cases due to the lack of standardized large-scale scenarios for testing, and due to the large computation time required to obtain a centralized MPC action for performance comparison with DMPC strategies under consideration. The second problem is exacerbated when the scale of the system grows. To address these challenges and to provide a real-world-based and control-independent benchmark, the EEA-ENB has been developed.

This package is an improved and unified version of three previously developed packages: [DeepRank](https://github.com/DeepRank/deeprank), [DeepRank-GNN](https://github.com/DeepRank/Deeprank-GNN), and [DeepRank-Mut](https://github.com/DeepRank/DeepRank-Mut).  As input, DeepRank2 takes [PDB-formatted](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/docs/UsersGuide/tutorials/pdbintro.html) atomic structures, and map them to graphs, where nodes can represent either residues or atoms, as chosen by the user, and edges represent the interactions between them. DeepRank2 has the option to choose between two types of queries as input for the featurization phase:  - PPIs, for mining interaction patterns within protein-protein complexes, implemented by the `ProteinProteinInterfaceQuery` class; - SRVs, for mining mutation phenotypes within protein structures, implemented by the `SingleResidueVariantQuery` class.  The physico-chemical and geometrical features are then computed and assigned to each node and edge. The user can choose which features to generate from several pre-existing options defined in the package, or define custom features modules, as explained in the documentation. The graphs can then be mapped to 3D-grids as well. The generated data can be used for training neural networks. DeepRank2 also offers a pre-implemented training pipeline, using either [CNNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) (for 3D-grids) or [GNNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_neural_network) (for graphs), as well as output exporters for evaluating performances.  Main features:  - Predefined atom-level and residue-level feature types   - e.g. atom/residue type, charge, size, potential energy   - All features' documentation is available [here](https://deeprank2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features.html) - Predefined target types   - binary class, CAPRI categories, DockQ, RMSD, and FNAT   - Detailed docking scores documentation is available [here](https://deeprank2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docking.html) - Flexible definition of both new features and targets - Features generation for both graphs and 3D-grids - Efficient data storage in HDF5 format - Support for both classification and regression (based on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [PyTorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/))  📚 [Documentation](https://deeprank2.rtfd.io/)  📣 [Discussions](https://github.com/DeepRank/deeprank2/discussions)  ## Acknowledgments  DeepRank2 software has been developed within the [3D-Vac project](https://research-software-directory.org/projects/3dvac), funded by the Netherlands eScience Center (NLESC.OEC.2021.008). In addition to this core budget, we have obtained two fundings specific for software sustainability (SS). The first one was dedicated to improving the user experience of DeepRank2 by introducing a more adaptable interface intended for a wider audience. It also aimed to consolidate the original [DeepRank](https://github.com/DeepRank/deeprank), [DeepRank-GNN](https://github.com/DeepRank/Deeprank-GNN) and [DeepRank-Mut](https://github.com/DeepRank/DeepRank-Mut) packages into DeepRank2, intended to become the standard for developers and users. The second SS budget is still ongoing, and aims at expanding the current DeepRank2 package for handling highly diverse 3D molecular complexes composed of nucleic acids (e.g., DNA, RNA), proteins, and inorganic molecules.",https://github.com/DeepRank/deeprank2,DeepRank/deeprank2

Consequently, functions for the Sentinel-2 satellites of the Copernicus system are closest to completion.  This library has two aspects  * photohypsometry: extracting elevation change from changing shadow cast * photogrammetry: extracting displacement or disparity through changes in observation time and of angle  This library can be used for a multitude of purposes, though the main focused lies towards the following products:  * glacier elevation change * glacier velocity * ocean circulation * natural mass movements * earthquake displacements",https://github.com/GO-Eratosthenes/dhdt,GO-Eratosthenes/dhdt

The communication between the application and Agate requires application authentication: an application is assigned a secret key that must be provided when accessing Agate. See corresponding documentation of each OBiBa application to know how to register an application key.  Once identified an application can authenticate a user, get its profile, send emails to all users or a group of users having access to this application.  ## Groups Users can be member of one or several groups. Application access can be declared on a group basis: users who are members of a group inherit from its application accesses.  ## Users A user is the one who will be authenticated and who will receive the notification emails. A user entry can be added by different ways:  * Agate administrator can directly add a new user, * A user can submit a join request, either from the Agate web interface or from the Mica sign up page.  The user join requests are protected by Google reCaptcha service.  A user can manage its personal information from the Agate web interface or from the Mica user profile page. Password management (first password and password recovery) is automatically done by the exchange of emails between the user and the Agate server: no administrator action is required.  ## Email Templates Email notifications are HTML template-based, allowing to fully customize your communication with users: links to resources, style, site policies etc.  ## Administration With Agate, you can: * Extend user profile attributes (apply to the join request form), * Manage users, groups and applications, * Manage user sessions: timeouts and user activity tracking.",https://github.com/obiba/agate,obiba/agate

By default, it uses a very flexible document oriented database to store any text-based attributes or data objects.  Altas creators may create a series of ""schemas"" to help define how to display and input documents that share a common set of attributes including geometries and relationships to other schemas. This flexible system allows for iterative development of functionality as you begin to see patterns in the data. Your editor users can create their own attributes and provide any sort of attachment. As the data evolves, schemas and atlas functionality can be modified to accommodate attributes or attachment types that might not have been originally anticipated.  Documents can have any number of attachments such as zip files, images, videos, office documents, mapping data, etc. Many popular image, video, sound, and location formats can be accepted and converted to web-ready formats by the Nunaliit server-side automatically.  A modern HTML/CSS/JS web client with OpenLayers mapping functionality is served to a user's browser and interacts with the database and a handful of media conversion servlets to permit rich interactivity with the data and editing/uploading of content and map geometries.  Nunaliit has also been designed to support distributed multi-master atlases at remote locations including map-less remote offline use on mobile devices for video, photo, sound, and location recording as well as document, attribute, and schema editing. At the moment, a developer build of an iPad application exists and has been tested in the Yukon and Northwest Territories by a partner group. Efforts are underway to support Android devices as well.",https://github.com/GCRC/nunaliit,GCRC/nunaliit

Traditionally, comparing these reproductions has been a labour-intensive process, constrained by manual examination and limited case studies.   The software called **Unraphael** introduces a digital workflow tool designed to enhance the analysis of paintings and their reproductions by uncovering the various transfer methods employed in creating copies. Focusing on Raphael’s oeuvre, this software covers a comprehensive pipeline utilizing advanced computer vision techniques to precisely extract and compare figure outlines across reproductions. This pipeline includes preprocessing, background removal and individual figure extraction, image alignment, and clustering based on structural similarity indices and brushstroke signatures. This enables the differentiation of various transfer techniques with high accuracy.   This software demonstrates that computer vision can substantially refine the examination of differences and similarities between original works and their reproductions. It not only offers new insights into Raphael's artistic practices but also enhances our understanding of copying techniques from the 15th and 16th centuries.",https://github.com/DecodingRaphael/unraphael,DecodingRaphael/unraphael

Neuroscientists train animals, often rodents, in behavioral tasks over several months, however training protocols are sometimes not well defined and this leads to delays in research, additional costs, or the need of more animals. Finding strategies to optimize animal training in safe and ethical ways is therefore of crucial importance in neuroscience.  ANNUBeS, which stays for _Artificial Neural Networks to Uncover Behavioral Strategies_, is a deep learning framework meant to generate synthetic data and train on them neural networks aimed at developing and evaluating animals' training protocols in neuroscience. The package gives the users the possibility to generate behavioral data in a very flexible way, that can be used to train neural networks in the same way that animals are trained, and study whether the developed models can predict the behavior of the animals.

Go to the [Google Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-fair-extension/pjmiddoifhbhbfcppdbmaigdeoiochdg) and add the extension to your browser.<br> 2. Navigate to the webpage you want to evaluate.<br> 3. Activate the extension by clicking on its icon.<br> 4. The extension will detect and highlight DOIs on the webpage. Click ""Evaluate"" next to a DOI to assess it.<br> 5. Open the extension popup by clicking its icon on the top-right of your browser to see the evaluation results.<br>  __Note:__ The evaluation process takes 2 to 5 seconds, depending on the website.  Here's an example of how the extension works using [this dataset](https://dataverse.nl/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.34894/Q80QUE).  --- ## Quickstart for Developers  ### To edit the project:<br> 1. Download the project as a Zip folder.<br> 2. Extract the folder.<br> 3. Open the project in a code editor such as Visual Studio Code.<br>  ### Working files:  - **Manifest.json**: Controls the structure of the extension, from essential elements like the title to complex features such as permissions and workflows.<br>  - **background.js**: Acts as a medium between the extension's files, maintaining communication between content scripts and popup JSON files. It also handles redirection to the DOI.<br>  - **popup.js**: Triggered by index.html. It modifies the user's view of the popup, including the DOI evaluation. This file also controls the communication between the extension and the FAIR-enough API.<br>  - **index.html**: The front end of the Chrome extension's popup. You can edit the style of the extension in this file.<br>  - **contentScript.js**: Triggered when the extension is given access. It injects scripts into the website to highlight text, detects DOIs in the webpage, injects code to highlight them and adds buttons next to them, and sends the indicated DOI to background.js for evaluation.<br>  --- ## Use Cases    1. A student wanting to use a DO (e.g. software package) must know which to choose. The FAIR extension will indicate which one is more FAIR and aid the decision-making process 2. A Data steward recommending sources 3. A researcher who wants to display all FAIR metrics of their DOs on a research profile 4. A PI that wants to evaluate an aggregated metric for a project.  --- ## About 👓  The scientific community’s efforts have increased regarding evaluating the FAIRness of research Digital Objects such as publications, datasets, or research software. However, this requires a steep learning curve for the average researcher when learning the FAIR evaluation frameworks, disengaging some.  This project aims to use technology close this gap and make this process more accessible by bringing the FAIR evaluation to the researcher’s profiles. “The FAIR extension” is an open-source, user-friendly web browser extension allowing researchers to do FAIRness evaluations directly from scholarly aggregators such as PURE, Google Scholar, or ResearchGate without additional knowledge. The browser extension follows the FAIR metrics group specification, building on top of the community-accepted FAIR evaluators’ APIs.   We aim to demonstrate that low-entry-level tools can bridge the gap between the researcher and the FAIR metrics. e.g. A data steward recommending FAIR sources or a researcher evaluating all FAIR metrics directly on scholarly profiles.  The development of this extension is made possible thanks to the [Netherlands eScience Center fellowship grant 2022-2023](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/fellowship-programme/)  ### - Contact  If there is an issue, please open one at [Issues](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-Library/the-FAIR-extension/issues).

a20d0996-dfa8-4acb-960c-1b44051fbc87,arpra,Arpra,"Arpra is a C library for (Ar)bitrary-(p)recision (r)ange (a)nalysis of IEEE-754 floating-point computations, based on GNU MPFR. The main use-case of Arpra is to maintain computed upper and lower bounds of numerical error for all variables, at all times, throughout a computation. Arpra uses mixed trimmed interval/affine arithmetic with deviation term reduction to accomplish this.  Affine arithmetic is a variant of interval arithmetic which accounts for variable correlations. As such, it does not suffer from the so-called 'dependency problem', where intervals grow overly large due to lack of consideration for variable correlations. The problem is described further at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_arithmetic#Dependency_problem>. By combining the results of interval arithmetic and affine arithmetic, one avoids both the dependency problem of interval arithmetic, and the nonlinear function overshoot/undershoot problem of affine arithmetic.  Arpra implements affine arithmetic using a GNU MPFR backend. MPFR is an arbitrary-precision floating-point library, meaning the floating-point MPFR variables can be of arbitrary precision. For more information, refer to the MPFR project website at <http://www.mpfr.org/>. By implementing affine arithmetic with an arbitrary-precision backend, one is able, for example, to test how a change in numerical precision or integration scheme affects local and global error during a long numerical simulation, without the interval 'explosion' problem regular interval arithmetic suffers from.  For further information on the implementation and features of Arpra, such as range trimming and deviation term reduction, refer to the original published article:  Turner, J. P., & Nowotny, T.

Those measures tend to work well for nearly equal spectra, i.e. cases of very high peak overlap. We recently introduced Spec2Vec an unsupervised machine learning approach for computing spectrum similarities based on learned relationships between peaks across large training datasets [ref]. Spec2Vec based similarity scores were observed to correlate more strongly than classical cosine-like scores with actual structural similarities between the underlying compounds. Additional core advantages are its fast computation, which allows to compare query spectra against very large libraries, and the fact that -as an unsupervised method- it can be trained on non-annotated data. However, the downside of an unsupervised approach is that it does not make use of the large fraction of labels that we have for the training data. The used training data (MS/MS spectra from GNPS) contains smiles/InChI annotations hence does allow to create molecular fingerprints for quantifying the structural similarities.",https://github.com/matchms/ms2deepscore,matchms/ms2deepscore

COPASI is widely used to model metabolic and signaling pathways, pharmacology, genetics, and many areas of chemistry, with special emphasis on microkinetic modeling.   Users define models in COPASI by focusing on the biochemistry components (species, reactions, kinetic rate laws, etc.) and the software automatically builds the corresponding mathematical equations. This feature makes it quickly accessible to biologists and chemists as model-building strongly relies on their domain knowledge, and minimizes the mathematical and programming skills required to a minimum.  COPASI allows many different types of time-dependent models (i.e. models where diffusion is not explicit), using several formalisms: ODEs, stochastic differential equations (SDEs), stochastic simulation with the Gillespie algorithm, and hybrid models where some variables are modeled with ODEs and others with the Gillespie approach. Additionally all the models can include discrete events, making such models hybrid continuous-discrete.   The most widely used functionality of COPASI is parameter estimation, where one fits parameter values of a model to experimental data. Users are able to associate an arbitrary number of experiments with the model variables and COPASI automatically builds a least-squares objective function for minimization which is carried out by nonlinear optimization algorithms (gradient-based, evolutionary algorithms, simulated annealing, particle swarm and several others). The user can additionally add any type of nonlinear constraints (for example, that a ratio of two concentrations must be above a certain value).  COPASI provides several methods to characterize models including algorithms for sensitivity analysis, stability analysis, cross-sections, Lyapunov exponents, and generic optimization. Additionally COPASI exposes its features to other programs through libraries and APIs available in several languages (Java, R, Python, etc.)",https://github.com/copasi/COPASI,copasi/COPASI

It tries to offer a consistent environment for workflows, so that a workflow sent to resource A will work unchanged on resource B as well.  To achieve this, and to offer a bit of safety and perhaps security, Cerise does not allow running arbitrary CWL command line tools. Instead, it expects the user to submit a workflow document that refers to predefined steps built into the service.  Defining these steps, and adding them to the service, is called specialising the service. A specialisation of Cerise is always specific to a project (which determines which steps are available and what inputs and outputs they have), and to a compute resource (which determines how they are implemented).

Specifically, the time it takes for an audio signal to decrease in volume by 60 dB is important. This can be estimated with Sabine's and Eyring's formula's, which both make use of the average absorption coefficient of the materials in a room. This absorption coefficient indicates how much of the original audio signal is absorbed into the material. However, measuring these absorption coefficients for a material is difficult and time consuming.  In this study, a machine learning approach is used to estimate the absorption coefficients, by using the room impulse response in combination with the layout of a room. A room impulse response is the characterizing sound of a room. These two pieces of data are processed through a convolutional neural network and a multilayer perceptron, respectively, and combined to make the final prediction of absorption coefficients. A novel approach of simulating the data is used, and a real dataset is used in conjunction with the simulations to use a state-of-the-art regression loss function made for domain adaptation. The results show that the machine learning approach still has a large error compared to using Eyring's formula, and that machine learning is not yet a viable option to use instead of conventional methods.

a97a7f4d-0dca-4375-85a5-a00ed83870e0,lara,LARA,"**LARA** (Laboratory Automation Robotic Assistant) is an open source **Research Data Management Suite** and 2nd generation Electronic Lab Notebook with the goal to automate most of the data and metadata entering process by providing a rich infrastructure for lab communication, orchestration, data/metadata storage, evaluation and exchange. It utilises [Ontology](https://gitlab.com/opensourcelab/scientificdata/ontologies) based semantic web technology to make data findable [via SPARAQL](https://w3c.org/sparql).  **LARA** is designed to reduce manual data entry by humans to the bare minimum, since **scientists should fokus on the creative part of their research** (""no one likes to enter data by hand, if a machine can do it""). This is achieved by a very fine grained, [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) based API and a semantic, ontology based representation of most items.  Please note, that **LARA** is still in a vivid development stage, so please be not disappointed, if there are ""hickups"" or ""gaps"". We are very happy for any feeback and proposals via [LARA gitlab issues](https://gitlab.com/groups/LARAsuite/-/issues), it should be a community project, so please feel free to contribute !! **Thank you very much in advance !!**   ### [Planning](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django-projects)  Scientific research is structured in **LARA** in [Projects](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django-projects) and [Experiments](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django-projects):  [Projects](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django-projects) can have as many sub-experiments as desired, similarily, [Experiments](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django-projects) can have many *sub-experiments*.   ### [Process](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django-processes) [Orchestration](https://gitlab.com/opensourcelab/laborchestrator) / [Scheduling](https://gitlab.com/opensourcelab/pythonlabscheduler)  Experiments can be structured in [Processes](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django-processes) and [Procedures](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django-processes). [Processes](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django-processes) describe ""what"" is done in an experiment, while [Procedures](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django-processes) describe ""how"" it is done.  [Processes](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django-processes) and [Procedures](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django-processes) can be denoted in the [pythonLab Procdure/Process description language](https://gitlab.com/opensourcelab/pythonLab),  a very powerful, yet simple language, even suited for very complex procdures and processes, including loops, conditions, etc., enabling closed loop automation / experiments.   These [Processes](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django-processes) and [Procedures](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django-processes) are then executed by the [Lab Orchestrator](https://gitlab.com/opensourcelab/laborchestrator) and [pythonlab scheduler](https://gitlab.com/opensourcelab/pythonlabscheduler), which communicate with the corresponding [SiLA servers](https://sila-standard.com/), like [instruments, reactors, robots](https://gitlab.com/opensourcelab/devices), machine learning algorithms or even humans (human feedback is informed/integrated via an app).   The [Laborchestrator](https://gitlab.com/opensourcelab/laborchestrator) is a microservice that receives messages from the [LARA Django API](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django) to orchestrate the execution of experiments and procedures on the corresponding SiLA servers. The [pythonlab scheduler](https://gitlab.com/opensourcelab/pythonlabscheduler) microservice calculates the best schedule in which order the process and procedure steps should be executed.   ### [Data Collection](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django-data-collector)  The [Data Collector](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django-data-collector) is a microservice that receives messages from the [Laborchestrator](https://gitlab.com/opensourcelab/laborchestrator) to collect data from [corresponding SiLA servers](https://gitlab.com/opensourcelab/devices), if data is ready for collection and stores the data in the corresponding [LARA data database](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django-data). Larger datasets are not directly stored in the database, but in an S3-compliant object storage, [minio](https://min.io/) by default, and only linked to the entries in the database. We recoommend to store the data in an efficient, open data format, like [SciDat](https://gitlab.com/opensourcelab/scientificdata/scidat), which combines tabular data with (semantic, [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) based) metadata in a single, compact file.  ### [LARA database](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django)  The [LARA database](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django) is [python django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) based and consist of many modules (the current set can be [easily expanded](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django-app-cookiecutter) by specific applications):   Currently we have modules for [Procdures, Processes and Methods](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django-processes), [Material - Parts, Devices and Labware](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django-material),  [Substances, Polymers, Mixtures and Reactions](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django-substances), [Sequences, like DNA, RNA, peptide/protein sequences](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django-sequences), [3D Structures of molecules](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django-structure), [Organisms](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django-organisms), [Samples](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django-samples), [Data](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django-data) and for the management of [Scientists, Institutions, Companies, etc.](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django-people).  **LARA** differentiates between ""abstract"" entities, like ""the substance ethanol in general with its generic properties molecular weight and sum formula etc."" or ""thermometer"" as a ""generic thermometer as a device for measureing temperature"" and an ""instance"" of these abstracta: ""the bottle of ethanol in a particular lab from a particular vendor"" / ""the thermometer of vendor x with a temperature range 250-350K"".  These instance information of individual objects is stored in the corresponding stores. Currently,  [Substance Store](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django-substances-store), [Material Store](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django-material-store) and [Organism Store](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django-organisms-store).  These stores can also be used as **""free"" inventories** for the lab (ordering workflows will follow soon).  The *""class/abstractum""* versus *""instance/individuum""* paradigm is a common design paradigm in **LARA**.  ### [Semantic Database](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django)  For the semantic representation of the items a triple store is used, which is based on [openlink virtuoso](https://virtuoso.openlinksw.com/). The terms are defined in [Ontologies](https://gitlab.com/opensourcelab/scientificdata/ontologies). This semantic representation is used to make the data findable via [SPARQL](https://w3c.org/sparql). The semantic information generated automatically, when new database items are created.  ### [Data(-base) Synchronisation](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django-data-sync)  Selected parts of projects, experiments and data can be synchronised with other LARA instances via the [Data Synchronisation](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django-data-sync) microservice.  ### [Data Evaluation](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django-data-evaluator)  Data can be evaluated via the [Data Evaluation](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django-data-evaluator) microservice, which is based on [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [numpy](https://numpy.org/) and [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/).  The evalated data is then visualised via default [Data Visualisations](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django-data).  For more advanced evaluations and visualisations, [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) can be used, as all data is accessible via the [LARA gRPC APIs](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django).  ### [Search](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django)  For simple searches, each Module has a search function, which can be used to search for specific items. For more advanced, complex searches, the [LARA SPARQL Endpoint](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django) can be used.   ## [Installation](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django/-/blob/master/README.md?ref_type=heads)  Installation is made as easy as possible via only two commands. The recommended installation method for testing is currently via [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) as described in the [README.md of the lara-django repository](https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite/lara-django). [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) is now part of a recent docker installations, so no additional installation is required.  ## Related Projects  More generic Modules can be found at our [OpenSourceLab Project](https://gitlab.com/opensourcelab).",https://gitlab.com/LARAsuite,

LORIS was designed from inception to facilitate active multi-site study management and centralized archiving and retrieval of multi-modal data.  The initial instance of LORIS included behavioural data entry functionality, scoring algorithms and normative lookup tables coded directly into the database for the full battery of measures. An imaging browser was added soon after for management and quality control procedures. Querying capabilities were eventually included using our Data Query Tool with the public dissemination phase of the study in 2006.  Having completed the full lifecycle of the NIHPD multi-site study, LORIS was adopted as the data platform for IBIS (Infant Brain Imaging Study), the Autism sibling study of brain development. Eventually, LORIS began to proliferate globally to numerous projects.  Numerous tools and modules have since been incorporated into the platform to facilitate data management, quality control, and sharing efforts. Web-based imaging visualization was introduced via BrainBrowser in 2011.  LORIS’ extensive suite of modules is deployed in numerous projects globally with code contributions coming from an ever-growing community of developers.",https://github.com/aces/Loris,aces/Loris

Neerincx, Nadyne L. Aretz, Mahira Ali, Arsen Ekinci and Willem-Paul Brinkman. In this paper, we conduct a mixed-methods analysis of people's relationship and willingness to continue working with the text-based virtual coach Sam.   Data:   Our analysis is based on the data collected in an online experiment in which more than 500 daily smokers interacted with the text-based virtual coach (i.e., a conversational agent) in up to 5 sessions spread over at least 9 days. In each session, Sam proposed a new preparatory activity for quitting smoking or becoming more physically active, with the latter possibly aiding the former. After the 5 sessions, participants filled in a post-questionnaire in which they answered 6 questions about their attitude toward Sam by means of a rating on a scale from -5 to 5 and a free-text response to the follow-up question ""Why do you think so?"" The questions were adapted based on the ones by Provoost et al. (2020). Our paper focuses on people's responses to the questions ""Do you prefer continuing or stopping to work with the conversational agent Sam?"" (-5: ""Definitely prefer stopping"", 5: ""Definitely prefer continuing"") and ""How would you characterize your relationship with the conversational agent Sam?"" (-5: ""Complete stranger"", 5: ""Close friend""). The complete dataset can be found here: https://doi.org/10.4121/19934783.v1. Notably, this dataset contains only data used to study the acceptance of the virtual coach Sam. Further data from the same study has been published in separate repositories (e.g., https://doi.org/10.4121/20284131.v2).   Virtual coach:   The implementation of the virtual coach is available here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6319356.

The ""Beyond the Book"" project investigates whether web resources like Wikipedia can be used to establish the level of cultural bias. This work describes the eScience tools used to estimate the cultural appeal of a book: semantic linking is used to identify key words in the text of the book, and afterwards the revision information from corresponding Wikipedia articles is examined to identify countries that generated a more than average amount of contributions to those articles. Comparison between the number of contributions from two countries on the same set of articles may show with which knowledge the contributors are familiar. We assume a lack of contributions from a country may indicate a gap in the knowledge of readers from that country. We assume that a book dealing with that concept could be more exotic and therefore more appealing for certain readers, while others are therefore less interested in the book. An indication of the 'level of exoticness' thus could help a reader/publisher to decide to read/translate the book or not. Experimental results are presented for four selected books from a set of 564 books written in Dutch or translated into Dutch, assessing their potential appeal for a Canadian audience. A qualitative assessment of quantitative results provides insight into named entities that may indicate a high/low cultural bias towards a book.",https://github.com/c-martinez/BeyondTheBook,c-martinez/BeyondTheBook

b539c338-2661-4882-869b-d0d9b21a12c8,sleplet,SLEPLET,"[SLEPLET](https://github.com/astro-informatics/sleplet) is a Python package for the construction of Slepian wavelets in the spherical and manifold (via meshes) settings. In contrast to other codes, `SLEPLET` handles any spherical region as well as the general manifold setting. The API is documented and easily extendible, designed in an object-orientated manner. Upon installation, `SLEPLET` comes with two command line interfaces - `sphere` and `mesh` - that allow one to easily generate plots on the sphere and a set of meshes using [plotly](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py). Whilst these scripts are the primary intended use, `SLEPLET` may be used directly to generate the Slepian coefficients in the spherical/manifold setting and use methods to convert these into real space for visualisation or other intended purposes. The construction of the sifting convolution was required to create Slepian wavelets. As a result, there are also many examples of functions on the sphere in harmonic space (rather than Slepian) that were used to demonstrate its effectiveness. `SLEPLET` has been used in the development of several papers.  ## Background  Wavelets are widely used in various disciplines to analyse signals both in space and scale. Whilst many fields measure data on manifolds (i.e. the sphere), often data are only observed on a partial region of the manifold. Wavelets are a typical approach to data of this form, but the wavelet coefficients that overlap with the boundary become contaminated and must be removed for accurate analysis. Another approach is to estimate the region of missing data and to use existing whole-manifold methods for analysis. However, both approaches introduce uncertainty into any analysis. Slepian wavelets enable one to work directly with only the data present, thus avoiding the problems discussed above. Applications of Slepian wavelets to areas of research measuring data on the partial sphere include gravitational/magnetic fields in geodesy, ground-based measurements in astronomy, measurements of whole-planet properties in planetary science, geomagnetism of the Earth, and cosmic microwave background analyses.  ## Statement of Need  Many fields in science and engineering measure data that inherently live on non-Euclidean geometries, such as the sphere. Techniques developed in the Euclidean setting must be extended to other geometries. Due to recent interest in geometric deep learning, analogues of Euclidean techniques must also handle general manifolds or graphs. Often, data are only observed over partial regions of manifolds, and thus standard whole-manifold techniques may not yield accurate predictions. Slepian wavelets are designed for datasets like these. Slepian wavelets are built upon the eigenfunctions of the Slepian concentration problem of the manifold: a set of bandlimited functions that are maximally concentrated within a given region. Wavelets are constructed through a tiling of the Slepian harmonic line by leveraging the existing scale-discretised framework. Whilst these wavelets were inspired by spherical datasets, like in cosmology, the wavelet construction may be utilised for manifold or graph data.  To the author's knowledge, there is no public software that allows one to compute Slepian wavelets (or a similar approach) on the sphere or general manifolds/meshes. [SHTools](https://github.com/SHTOOLS/SHTOOLS) is a `Python` code used for spherical harmonic transforms, which allows one to compute the Slepian functions of the spherical polar cap. A series of `MATLAB` scripts exist in [slepian_alpha](https://github.com/csdms-contrib/slepian_alpha), which permits the calculation of the Slepian functions on the sphere. However, these scripts are very specialised and hard to generalise.  Whilst Slepian wavelets may be trivially computed from a set of Slepian functions, the computation of the spherical Slepian functions themselves are computationally complex, where the matrix scales as 𝒪(𝐿⁴). Although symmetries of this matrix and the spherical harmonics have been exploited, filling in this matrix is inherently slow due to the many integrals performed. The matrix is filled in parallel in `Python` using [concurrent.futures](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html), and the spherical harmonic transforms are computed in `C` using [SSHT](https://github.com/astro-informatics/ssht). This may be sped up further by utilising the new [ducc0](https://github.com/mreineck/ducc) backend for `SSHT`, which may allow for a multithreaded solution. Ultimately, the eigenproblem must be solved to compute the Slepian functions, requiring sophisticated algorithms to balance speed and accuracy. Therefore, to work with high-resolution data such as these, one requires high-performance computing methods on supercomputers with massive memory and storage. To this end, Slepian wavelets may be exploited at present at low resolutions, but further work is required for them to be fully scalable.  ## Example Usage  `SLEPLET` may be interacted with via the API or the CLIs.  ### API Usage  The following demonstrates the first wavelet (ignoring the scaling function) of the South America region on the sphere.  ```python import sleplet  B, J, J_MIN, L = 3, 0, 2, 128  region = sleplet.slepian.Region(mask_name=""south_america"") f = sleplet.functions.SlepianWavelets(L, region=region, B=B, j_min=J_MIN, j=J) f_sphere = sleplet.slepian_methods.slepian_inverse(f.coefficients, f.L, f.slepian) sleplet.plotting.PlotSphere(     f_sphere,     f.L,     f""slepian_wavelets_south_america_{B}B_{J_MIN}jmin_{J_MIN+J}j_L{L}"",     normalise=False,     region=f.region, ).execute() ```  ![Slepian Wavelet j=2](https://github.com/astro-informatics/sleplet/blob/main/documentation/slepian_wavelets_south_america_3B_2jmin_2j_L128_res512_real.png?raw=true)  ### CLI Usage  The demonstrates the first wavelet (ignoring the scaling function) of the head region of a Homer Simpson mesh for a per-vertex normals field.  ```sh mesh homer -e 3 2 0 -m slepian_wavelet_coefficients -u -z ```  ![Slepian Mesh Wavelet Coefficients j=2](https://github.com/astro-informatics/sleplet/blob/main/documentation/slepian_wavelet_coefficients_homer_3B_2jmin_2j_zoom.png?raw=true)  ## Citing  If you use `SLEPLET` in your research, please cite the paper.  ```bibtex @article{Roddy2023,   title   = {%raw%}{{SLEPLET: Slepian Scale-Discretised Wavelets in Python}}{%endraw%},   author  = {Roddy, Patrick J.},   year    = 2023,   journal = {Journal of Open Source Software},   volume  = 8,   number  = 84,   pages   = 5221,   doi     = {10.21105/joss.05221}, } ```  Please also cite [S2LET](https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201220729) upon which `SLEPLET` is built, along with [SSHT](https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2166394) in the spherical setting or [libigl](https://doi.org/10.1145/3134472.3134497) in the mesh setting.  ## Acknowledgements  The author would like to thank Jason D.

It lets the user iteratively train and retrain classification models in seconds. Traditional machine learning approaches can lack intelligent predictions, while deep neural nets typically require vast amounts of training data and compute. Our tool combines a pretrained UNet for feature extraction with a RandomForest for classification. We therefore leverage strong points of both. The use of a UNet makes it possible to take into account complex patterns and encode these in a feature space. The RandomForest is then trained on top of those features with little labeled data, and only seconds (or minutes) of compute time required. This allows for an interactive and explorative user experience.  CoeusAI uses the functionalities of the command-line-tool and Python package, Pycoeus, it's main dependency, and makes them available with a user-friendly graphical user-interface to use in QGIS.",https://github.com/DroneML/CoeusAI,DroneML/CoeusAI

However, working with these types is cumbersome: mathematical operations require intrinsics (e.g., `__hadd2` performs addition for `__half2`), type conversion is awkward (e.g., `__nv_cvt_halfraw2_to_fp8x2` converts float16 to float8), and some functionality is missing (e.g., one cannot convert a `__half` to `__nv_bfloat16`).  _Kernel Float_ resolves this by offering a single data type `kernel_float::vec<T, N>` that stores `N` elements of type `T`. Internally, the data is stored as a fixed-sized array of elements. Operator overloading (like `+`, `*`, `&&`) has been implemented such that the most optimal intrinsic for the available types is selected automatically. Many mathetical functions (like `log`, `exp`, `sin`) and common operations (such as `sum`, `range`, `for_each`) are also available.

Abstract  Group Equivariant Convolutions (GConvs) enable convolutional neural networks to be equivariant to various transformation groups, but at an additional parameter and compute cost. We investigate the filter parameters learned by GConvs and find certain conditions under which they become highly redundant. We show that GConvs can be efficiently decomposed into depthwise separable convolutions while preserving equivariance properties and demonstrate improved performance and data efficiency on two datasets.",https://data.4tu.nl/v3/datasets/fb66f3b9-5eef-4af6-a0b8-8ed1e63a6f0f.git,

In particular we present a modular architecture for implementing the transformation from user-friendly surface syntax into a small and well-behaved core language, also known as elaboration. Our architecture is made modular through the use of an open datatype of constraints and a plugin system for solvers that work on these constraints, which means that each new feature is contained in its own module.

For each pair of split read positions (rightmost position of the first split part and leftmost position of the second split part) a 2D Numpy array called window is constructed. The shape of a window is [window_size, number_of_channels], where the genomic interval encompassing the window is centered on the split read position with a context of [-100 bp, +100 bp) for a window_size of 200 bp. From all the reads overlapping this genomic interval and from the relative segment subsequence of the reference sequence 79 (number_of_channels) channels are constructed, where each channel encode a signal that can be used for SV calling. The list of channels can be found here. The two windows are joined as linked-windows with a zero padding 2D array of shape [10, number_of_channels] in between to avoid artifacts related to the CNN kernel in the part at the interface between the two windows. The linked-windows are labelled as SV when the split read positions overlap the SV callset used as the ground truth and noSV otherwise, where SV is either DEL,INS,INV,DUP or CTX according to the SV type.  2) Model training The labelled linked-windows are used to train a 1D CNN to learn to classify them as either SV or noSV. Two cross-validation strategies are possible: 10-fold cross-validation and cross-validation by chromosome, where one chromosome is used as the test set and the other chromosomes as the training set.  3) SV calling with a trained model Once a trained model is generated and the BAM file for the test set is converted into linked-windows, the SV calling is performed using the predict.py script.",https://github.com/GooglingTheCancerGenome/sv-channels/,GooglingTheCancerGenome/sv-channels

Despite their high predictive accuracy, DNNs lack inherent explainability. Many scientists do not harvest DNNs power because of lack of trust and understanding of their working. Meanwhile, the eXplainable AI (XAI) research offers some post-hoc (after training) interpretability methods that provide insight into the DNN reasoning by quantifying the relevance of individual features (image pixels, words in text, etc.) concerning the prediction. These relevance heatmaps indicate how the network has reached its decision directly in the input modality (images, text, speech etc.) of the scientific data. Representing visually the captured knowledge by the AI system can become a source of scientific insights. There are many Open Source Software (OSS) implementations of these methods, alas, supporting a single DNN format, while standards like Open Neural Network eXchange (ONNX) exist. The libraries are known mostly by the AI experts. For the adoption by the wide scientific community, understanding of the XAI methods, and well-documented and standardized OSS are needed. The DIANNA library supports the best XAI methods in the context of scientific usage providing their OSS implementation based on the ONNX standard and demonstrations on benchmark datasets.

HORTON is not designed to achieve bleeding-edge performance: readability, extensibility, and modifiability are often preferred over computational efficiency and code compactness when trade-offs are essential.  * HORTON is, and always will be, open source, distributed under the GNU General Public License. The HORTON development team always welcomes new contributions.  * HORTON is a research tool for both its developers and users. As a result, the available functionality is naturally biased towards the interests of its developers. The current focus of HORTON is on low-cost ab initio electronic structure theory methods and post-processing tools for interpreting electronic structure calculations. Additional functionality can be provided by other developers, and through interfaces to various programs. If you are interested in joining the HORTON development team, please contact us through the the HORTON mailing list.  * HORTON can used in three ways: as part of a larger program, as a stand-alone problem, outside other programs. Retaining this flexibility is a fundamental design principle of HORTON. Horton can be run as a stand-alone program using either input files or Python scripts. However, when HORTON’s functionality is limited or its computational requirements are too large, HORTON can be used in scripts for managing and post-processing calculations from other Schrödinger solver software. HORTON can also be used, to provide specialized functionality to a larger program (e.g., to update the atomic charges in a molecular dynamics simulation). To facilitate the use of HORTON within other programs, we guarantee no major API changes for at least twelve months after each major release.",https://github.com/theochem/horton/,theochem/horton

For such ideal systems anomaly detection is trivial, however for systems with unmatched uncertainties or measurement noise a dedicated detector is needed. In this code two of such robust anomaly detectors are implemented, which extend the anomaly detection capability of a large class of SMOs to include systems with unmatched uncertainties and measurement noise. The first detector is based on the so-called equivalent output injection (EOI), which is closely related to the anomaly estimate. The second detector is directly based on the SMO state estimation error. Doing so, the second detector bypasses the low-pass filter generating the EOI allowing for faster detection of anomalies and making it possible to detect smaller magnitude anomalies. The detectors are applied in this code to detect a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on a collaborative vehicle platoon (CVP).

It provides functionality to simultaneously record raw data from four sensors—tri-axis accelerometer, tri-axis gyroscope, barometer, and GPS—which should enable researchers to, for example, estimate energy expenditure and mine movement trajectories.  A Samsung smartwatch running the Tizen OS was chosen because of 1) the required functionalities of the smartwatch software API, 2) the availability of software development tools and accessible documentation, 3) having the required sensors, and 4) the requirements on case design for acceptance by the target user group.  WEARDA addresses five practical challenges concerning preparation, measurement, logistics, privacy preservation, and reproducibility to ensure efficient and errorless data collection. The software package was initially created for the project “Dementia back at the heart of the community”, and has been successfully used in that context.",https://github.com/LiacsProjects/Wearda,LiacsProjects/Wearda

d2ae3978-7d0f-48b2-9f04-c9bde2210c83,dune,DUNE (Distributed and Unified Numerics Environment),"**DUNE**, the *Distributed and Unified Numerics Environment* is a modular toolbox for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with grid-based methods. It supports the easy, flexible, and efficient implementation of finite element and finite volume methods. DUNE is written in C++, but has interfaces to Python as well.  ![DUNE design](https://www.dune-project.org/img/dunedesign.png)  The underlying idea of DUNE is to create slim interfaces that allow the efficient use of legacy and/or new libraries. Modern C++ programming techniques enable very different implementations of the same concept using a common interface at a very low overhead. Thus, DUNE ensures efficiency in scientific computations and supports high-performance computing applications.  Particular highlights are:   * A generic interface for finite element grids.  This interface allows to use a wide range of very different [grid data structures](https://www.dune-project.org/doc/grids/) from the same code  * An interface for [finite element bases](https://www.dune-project.org/modules/dune-functions/), together with a generic mechanism to construct complicated bases from simpler ones  * The [Iterative Solver Template Library](https://www.dune-project.org/modules/dune-istl/), featuring vector and matrix data structures that allow for many general nesting patterns  DUNE is free software licensed under the GPL (version 2) with a so-called ""runtime exception"" (see [**license**](https://www.dune-project.org/about/license/)). This licence is similar to the one under which the libstdc++ libraries are distributed. Thus, it is possible to use DUNE even in proprietary software.  #### DUNE is based on the following main principles:  * Separation of data structures and algorithms by abstract interfaces: _This provides more functionality with less code and also ensures maintainability and extendability of the framework._  * Efficient implementation of these interfaces using generic programming techniques: _Static polymorphism allows the compiler to do more optimizations, particularly function inlining, allowing the interface to have very small functions (implemented by one or few machine instructions) without a severe performance penalty. In essence, the algorithms are parametrized with a particular data structure, and the interface is removed at compile time. Thus the resulting code is as efficient as if it would have been written for the special case._  * Reuse of existing finite element packages with a large body of functionality: _In particular, the finite element codes UG, ALBERTA, and ALUGrid have been adapted to the DUNE framework. Thus, parallel and adaptive meshes with multiple element types and refinement rules are available. All these packages can be linked together in one executable._   ### Modules  The framework consists of several modules, which are downloadable as separate packages. There is a set of [core modules](https://www.dune-project.org/groups/core/) used by most other packages. The [dune-grid](https://www.dune-project.org/modules/dune-grid/) core module already contains some grid implementation, and further [grid managers](https://www.dune-project.org/groups/grid/) are available as extra modules. Main [discretization modules](https://www.dune-project.org/groups/disc/) provide the infrastructure for solving partial differential equations using DUNE, and are available as separate modules. The modular structure of DUNE allows for using a small set of the modules (e.g., only the solver module [dune-istl](https://www.dune-project.org/modules/dune-istl/) or the module [dune-localfunctions](https://www.dune-project.org/modules/dune-localfunctions/) containing shape functions without, for example, using the [dune-grid](https://www.dune-project.org/modules/dune-grid/) or a full discretization module).

However, the law is somewhat open to interpretation. This interpretation is done by judges whenever a case is brought to court. Over time, the outcome of individual cases build what is called _case law_.  Because consistency is crucial for the fair application of the law, cases often reference other cases: if the reasoning behind a ruling in one case also applies to another case, then the ruling should be the same. To warrant consistency it is thus paramount that any relevant rulings from previous cases are identified. Conventionally, both the justice department and the defense depend on legal experts to make this identification when preparing a case. However, court rulings are often difficult to understand, there is only limited time available, and even experts are not aware of all cases that may be relevant.  To help mitigate this situation, the Netherlands eScience Center worked together with Maastricht University to develop an interactive visualization that assists the legal community at large (prosecutors, judges, lawyers, legal aids, but also researchers and students) in analyzing case law.  The visualization has been implemented as follows. The collective of cases that together make up case law can be thought of as a network, or _graph_. Each node in the graph represents a case, while the edges represent references to other cases. The graph is represented visually to make it easy for a non-technical user to discover which cases are related. By using metrics from graph theory, such as _in-degree_, _out-degree_, _betweenness_, etc., the nodes in the graph can be annotated with additional information. The additional information helps a researcher quickly assess a node's importance.",https://github.com/NLeSC/case-law-app,NLeSC/case-law-app

For more intricate examples and detailed specifications, the paper serves as a comprehensive reference.  ```json {     ""study_id"": ""voicedata"",     ""subject_id"": ""recruit089"",     ""device_id"": ""audiotechnica02"",     ""endianness"": ""little"",     ""metadata_version"": ""0.1"",     ""start_iso8601"": ""2016-08-09T10:31:00.000+00:00"",     ""end_iso8601"": ""2016-08-10T10:31:30.000+00:00"",     ""sampling_rate"": 44100,     ""rows"": 1323000,     ""channels"": [         ""left"",         ""right""     ],     ""units"": [         ""unitless"",         ""unitless""     ],     ""compression"": ""none"",     ""data_type"": ""int"",     ""bits"": 16,     ""file_name"": ""audio_voice_089.raw"" } ``` **Explanation:**  - `study_id`: Identifies the study as ""voicedata"".  - `subject_id`: Specifies the subject as ""recruit089"".  - `device_id`: Indicates the device used as ""audiotechnica02"".  - `endianness`: Specifies the byte order as ""little"".  - `metadata_version`: Denotes the metadata version as ""0.1"".  - `start_iso8601` and `end_iso8601`: Define the start and end timestamps of data collection in ISO 8601 format.  - `sampling_rate`: Represents the data sampling rate as 44,100 samples per second.  - `rows`: Specifies the number of data rows as 1,323,000.  - `channels`: Lists the data channels as ""left"" and ""right"".  - `units`: Specifies the units for each channel as ""unitless"".  - `compression`: Indicates that no compression has been applied to the data.  - `data_type`: Defines the data type as ""int"".  - `bits`: Specifies the bit length as 16.  - `file_name`: Names the binary file ""audio_voice_089.raw"" that contains the described data.    ## The python library - `tsdf` This Python library facilitates the manipulation of Time Series Data Format (TSDF) metadata and binary files, providing users with a familiar and structured interface. Leveraging the power of numpy arrays, it simplifies the process of working with TSDF data, allowing users to efficiently read, write, and manipulate both metadata and binary data. This approach enhances data management and analysis, making it a valuable tool for researchers and data scientists dealing with extensive physiological sensor data.

We are committed to providing a platform for researchers to increase the value of their data through sharing with the community. This will greatly increase the amount of data available to answer complex questions about the adaptive immune response, accelerating the development of vaccines, therapeutic antibodies against autoimmune diseases, and cancer immunotherapies. Visit the COVID-19 page for a list of curated COVID-19 AIRR-seq studies.  # Our Approach The iReceptor Gateway integrates large, distributed, AIRR-seq data repositories, following standards for sharing and interoperability developed by the Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire (AIRR) Community. The main goal of iReceptor is to connect this distributed network of AIRR-seq repositories into an AIRR Data Commons, allowing queries across multiple projects, labs, and institutions.  Present functionalities include: * Search for repertoires satisfying certain metadata (e.g. find all AIRR-seq repertoires from ovarian cancer studies) * Search for all repertoires that contain specific CDR3 sequences * Search identified repertoires for sequences derived from particular V, D, and J genes and alleles * Download sequences from these repertoires in AIRR.tsv format, easily importable to other AIRR-seq analysis tools  iReceptor is a member of the iReceptor Plus Consortium. This project will expand the analysis tools available on the Gateway, including for single cell or systems immunology approaches, and add security for iReceptor Plus repositories.  Users of the iReceptor Gateway can search AIRR-seq data from studies on ovarian cancer, autoimmune diseases such as MS and SLE, and infectious diseases such as COVID-19 and HIV.

Moreover, a Longitudinal analysis is developed to assess agreement over time.  ## Usage ValidSense is a webbased application, consisting of five pages. Follow the instructions on these pages sequentially.  Detailed instructions are given in the web interface. This is a summary of the usage of the five pages.  1. Introduction: Information about the ValidSense software and the statistical methods is given here 2. Loading: Files must be uploaded here, and some filtering settings can be made. Use CSV or XLSX files 3. Preprocessing: The analysis variant is chosen, as well as variables and settings. Variants available:    - Limits of Agreement:       - Classic: Assess agreement in single pair of measurements per patient, [Bland & Altman 1986](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2868172/)      - Repeated measurements: Assess agreement in multiple measurements per patient,  	   [Bland & Altman 1999 section 5.2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10501650/), [Bland & Altman 2007 section 3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17613642/)       - Mixed-effects: Assess agreement based on the mixed-effects LoA analysis, allowing to correct, for example,  	   multiple measurements per patient or systematic relationship between the difference and mean, [Parker et al. 2016](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27973556/)      - Regression of difference: Assess agreement in a single measurement per patient, with a linear relationship between difference and mean for bias  	   and/or LoA, [Bland & Altman 1999 section 3.2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10501650/)    - Longitudinal analysis: a new method to assess agreement over time. 5. Limits of Agreement Analysis: The Bland-Altman plot is shown, along with information helping to check assumptions of the analysis 6. Longitudinal Analysis: The newly developed Longitudinal analysis can assess non-constant agreement over time.    The longitudinal analysis involves breaking down a dataset into smaller parts over time and applying existing LoA analysis to each part.    A moving time window is applied, and based on the data included in the window, the bias and 95% LoA are calculated for each time window.    The agreement plot graphical visualises the results of the longitudinal analysis. A window can be selected using the time slider,     shown in the Bland-Altman plot of a selected window, and allows the user to navigate through the time domain.

Abstract:  In this paper we propose a robust loudspeaker beamforming algorithm which is used to enhance the performance of voice driven applications in scenarios where the loudspeakers introduce the majority of the noise, e.g. when music is playing loudly. The loudspeaker beamformer modifies the loudspeaker playback signals to create a low-acoustic-energy region around the device that implements automatic speech recognition for a voice driven application (VDA). The algorithm utilises a distortion measure based on human auditory perception to limit the distortion perceived by human listeners. Simulations and real-world experiments show that the proposed loudspeaker beamformer improves the speech recognition performance in all tested scenarios. Moreover, the algorithm allows to further reduce the acoustic energy around the VDA device at the expense of reduced objective audio quality at the listener’s location.",https://data.4tu.nl/v3/datasets/fbc606b8-548e-40ca-ab39-50f5145c3db3.git,

Analysis of a dataset containing over 2,400 COFs reveals that conventional features such as density, pore size, void fraction, and surface area do not reliably predict thermal conductivity. To address this, an attention-based machine learning model was trained, accurately predicting thermal conductivities even for structures outside the training set. The attention mechanism was then utilized to investigate the model's success. The analysis identified dangling molecular branches as a key predictor of thermal conductivity, leading us to define the dangling mass ratio (DMR), a descriptor that quantifies the fraction of atomic mass in dangling branches relative to the total COF mass. Feature importance assessments on regression models confirm the significance of DMR in predicting thermal conductivity. These findings indicate that COFs with dangling functional groups exhibit lower thermal transfer capabilities. Molecular dynamics simulations support this observation, revealing significant mismatches in the vibrational density of states due to the presence of dangling branches.

Furthermore, the context of play is set so the future of work scenario story-line can be conveyed more effectively.   The software runs best on Unity version 2019.4.10, played on a HTC Vive system with two controllers. A brief explanation of how scenes and interactions can be added into the game can be found here.",,

Mica is a powerful software application used to create data web portals for large-scale epidemiological studies or multiple-study consortia. Mica2 is the successor of Mica.  Mica helps studies to provide scientifically robust data visibility and web presence without significant information technology effort. Mica provides a structured description of consortia, studies, annotated and searchable data dictionaries, and data access request management.  # Features Using Mica2, studies and consortia can administer and display information about themselves and about their constituants, this is:  ## Network Identification and Listing Mica2 provides a standardized way to describe both networks and the studies that constitute them.  ## Study Catalogue Mica2 study catalogue includes:  * A list of important study description default characteristics that can be customized to reflect specific requirements, * Support for longitudinal study design with data collection events, sub-populations and recruitment timelines.  ## Datasets Studies makes available different datasets to the research community. Mica2 provides: * A standard menu for its data resources, * Advanced variable search functionality using facets, * A detailed description of a dataset including a comprehensive dictionary of all the variables provided by the dataset.  Importantly, Mica2 does not store any record-level data itself. Instead, Mica2 includes for studies using the OBiBa Opal software as main secured database solution, a distributed query engine that enables authorized researchers to obtain real-time aggregated reports on the exact number of participant with specific characteristics or phenotypes. The same engine is used to obtain summary statistics on each variable. Using this approach, no individual-level data passes through Mica2, yet researchers can assess the suitability of a dataset for their needs.  ## Data Access Management Mica2 provides a way to edit forms that allows a study to handle access requests electronically. Using this feature, single studies or consortia can: * Present their Data Access Policy, * Manage Data Access Requests from submission to approval, * Extend default Data Access Request form to match their needs, * Present the Data Access Committee members.  ## Administration With Mica2, you can: * Administer your Consortium web portal from the website itself, * Define permissions on any kind of content.",https://github.com/obiba/mica2,obiba/mica2

We have previously developed DeepRank, a deep-learning framework to facilitate pattern learning from protein-protein interfaces using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approaches. However, CNN is not rotation invariant and data augmentation is required to desensitize the network to the input data orientation which dramatically impairs the computation performance. Representing protein-protein complexes as atomic- or residue-scale rotation invariant graphs instead enables using graph neural networks (GNN) approaches, bypassing those limitations.  We have developed DeepRank-GNN, a framework that converts protein-protein interfaces from PDB 3D coordinates files into graphs that are further provided to a pre-defined or user-defined GNN architecture to learn problem-specific interaction patterns. DeepRank-GNN is designed to be highly modularizable, easily customized, and is wrapped into a user-friendly python3 package. Here, we showcase DeepRank-GNN’s performance for scoring docking models using a dedicated graph interaction neural network (GINet). We show that this graph-based model performs better than DeepRank, DOVE and HADDOCK scores and competes with iScore on the CAPRI score set. We show a significant gain in speed and storage requirement using DeepRank-GNN as compared to DeepRank.  https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.08.471762v1",https://github.com/DeepRank/DeepRank-GNN,DeepRank/DeepRank-GNN

Abstract of the paper: GPU programs are widely used in industry. To obtain the best  performance, a typical development process involves the manual or  semi-automatic application of optimizations prior to compiling the code.  To avoid the introduction of errors, we can augment GPU programs with  (pre- and postcondition-style) annotations to capture functional  properties. However, keeping these annotations correct when optimizing  GPU programs is labor-intensive and error-prone. This paper  introduces Alpinist, an annotation-aware GPU program optimizer. It  applies frequently-used GPU optimizations, but besides transforming  code, it also transforms the annotations. We evaluate Alpinist, in  combination with the VerCors program verifier, to automatically optimize  a collection of verified programs and reverify them.",,

Although it contains some copyright materials, and some materials that are restricted for reasons to do with rights or work in progress, most CWRC content is licensed under a Creative Commons CC-BY-NC license for sharing and reuse, although other licenses are possible as is the application of Traditional Knowledge Labels for Indigenous Content.  ## Interoperable content Materials are stored in standard, preservation-friendly and interchange-friendly formats.  ## Existing content CWRC is seeded with a substantial body of existing materials. The Early Canadian Cultural Journals Index, published on CD-ROM, is now available again through CRWC. The Canadian Early Women Writers significantly updates and expands the work originally published as Canada’s Early Women Writers, positioning it for ongoing enhancement by the community. The Orlando Project will have CWRC as its new home and share its Canadian content.  ## Content in progress CWRC supports the production of born-digital content, from inception to dissemination, enabling scholars to explore the possibilities of collaboration at every stage of the research process. Individuals and teams have the option to develop their work in the open, to engage citizen scholars, within the walled garden of the Collaboratory in conversation with their peers, or to develop it behind the scenes and release their work in stages or as a whole once it is complete.  ## Dynamic content The results of digital scholarship need not repose. Rather, they can be updated, enhanced, revised, remixed, and redistributed as part of an ongoing process of knowledge production. CWRC provides the means for scholarly communities to support the knowledge and resources that matter to them.  ## Tools CWRC supports the creation, development, management, use, revision, enhancement, and publication of scholarly content through an extensive suite of tools that are accessible through the main CWRC interface.  ## Standards-oriented content creation The uploading of existing materials, and creation of metadata, text, and other content is designed to promote adherence to best practices for interoperability and preservation. The centerpiece of this strategy is the CWRC-Writer browser-based editor that allows the creation of structured text, linked metadata, and interoperable annotations.  ## Content management CWRC helps scholars keep track of the research process by allowing them to apply workflow stamps to record what has been done to materials, assign them to others, and draw on reports of sets of materials. This information is visualized in the forthcoming Credit Visualization (CV) tool that shows the contributions to individual items or collections of materials.  ## Content publication Content can be published at any stage. Alternatively, CWRC can also be used as a production environment and content published elsewhere, or within a separate interface that draws on the repository.   ## Open source tools CWRC builds on the open-source Islandora framework for a Fedora Commons repository. All code developed by the project is open-source in the project’s Github repository.   ## Programmatic access and extensibility CWRC is built on a RESTful service-oriented architecture with Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). The modular interface supports the addition of new components.   ## Customizable interfaces CWRC’s architecture allows projects to have their own customizable homepages as first points of access to their collections. It also allows projects to build and maintain their own Drupal multisite interfaces that draw on materials in the Collaboratory but provide specialized theming or functionality.     ## CWRC is upgrading From 2021 we are developing a new version of the platform based on the newest version of Islandora, with a more flexible interface and upgraded Fedora repository layer.",https://github.com/cwrc/beta.cwrc.ca,cwrc/beta.cwrc.ca

This is the file where input data is given for the creation of the Abaqus input file and the script file used to run the simulations. The user can choose which of the elastic properties they are interested in and provide dimensions and material properties for the tows and stitches. Stitches are created by providing the start and end-coordinate for each segment. This main file uses the ’RVE functions file’ and the ’scriptfile’ to get all the information required to write the output files.    It is also responsible for setting the interactions and contact between the different set and surfaces. The ’RVE functions file’ also creates the reference points that are used to apply the strains on the RVE. Finally. this file imports the constraint functions from the ’Constraint functions file’ to create the boundary conditions necessary to ensure the deformed surfaces of the RVE stay periodic.   Next is the ’Constraint functions file’. This file writes all the constraints for the nodes based on the different sets that are defined by Omairey et al. [1]. Omairey et al. [1] illustrate these sets in Figure 6. The linear constraints and load boundary conditions are given in Table 1 in their work [1].   The final file is the ’script file’. The basis of this file comes directly from the work by Omairey et al. [1]. It has been adapted to work with the other files and with the model as created for the current research. The ’script file’ writes the script file that is imported in Abaqus to run the simulations based on the  elastic properties that have been chosen in the ’RVE set-up file’. This is the part of the script where the strains to be applied to the RVE are set. It is also the part where the reaction forces are obtained that are used to calculate the Poison ratio’s, Young’s moduli and Shear moduli. Finally the script prints the desired results for the elastic properties and writes these to a text file.

ec7a05be-b4de-4d76-9308-92d9e98d5453,unrollingaverages,UnrollingAverages.jl,"## Overview   UnrollingAverages is a Julia package aimed at deconvolving simple moving averages of time series to get the original ones back.  UnrollingAverages currently assumes that the moving average is a [simple moving average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average#Simple_moving_average). Further relaxations and extensions may come in the future, see [Future Developments](#Future-Developments) section.  ## Installation  Press `]` in the Julia REPL and then  ```julia pkg> add UnrollingAverages ```  ## Usage  The package exports a single function called `unroll`: it returns a `Vector` whose elements are the possible original time series.  ```julia unroll(moving_average::Vector{Float64}, window::Int64; initial_conditions::U = nothing, assert_natural::Bool = false) where { U <: Union{ Tuple{Vararg{Union{Int64,Float64}}},Nothing} } ```  ### Arguments  - `moving_average`: the time series representing the moving average to unroll ; - `window`: the width of the moving average ; - `initial_conditions`: the initial values of the original time series to be recovered. It may be a `Tuple` of `window-1` positive integer values, or `nothing` if initial conditions are unknown. Currently it is not possible to specify values in the middle of the time series, this may be a feature to be added in the future ; - `assert_natural` default boolean argument. If true, the pipeline will try to recover a time series of natural numbers only. More then one acceptable time series (where ""acceptable"" means that it reproduces `moving_average`) may be found and all will be returned.  A few remarks:  1. If `isnothing(initial_conditions)`:    - `if assert_natural`, then an internal `unroll_iterative` method is called, which tries to exactly recover the whole time series, initial conditions included. Enter `?UnrollingAverages.unroll_iterative` in a Julia  to read further details;    - `if !assert_natural`, then an internal `unroll_linear_approximation` method is called. See this [StackExchange post](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/68002). NB: this is an approximated method, it will generally not return the exact original time series; 2. If `typeof(initial_conditions) <: Ntuple{window-1, <:Union{Int64,Float64}}`, then an internal `unroll_recursive` method is called, which exactly recovers the time series. Mathematical details about this function are reported in the [documentation](https://InPhyT.github.io/UnrollingAverages.jl/stable), and you may read more by entering `?UnrollingAverages.unroll_recursive`.  ## Future Developments  - Modify `initial_conditions` argument of `unroll` so that it accepts known values throughout the series ; - Implement reversing methods for other types of moving averages .  ## How to Contribute  If you wish to change or add some functionality, please file an [issue](https://github.com/InPhyT/UnrollingAverages.jl/issues).

Currently, it covers importing, editing, processing, visualizing, and analyzing EEG, MEP and EDA data. Preliminary functionality is also available for MEG, NIRS, ECoG, SEEG and iEEG recordings.  Various methods for modeling non-invasive brain stimulation protocols (tDCS/tACS/tRNS/tPCS/TMS/TUS/INS) will also be implemented (NeuroStim submodule). Another submodule, NeuroTester, will allow designing and running psychological studies. Certain neurophysiological data can be recorded using NeuroRecorder submodule.  NeuroAnalyzer contains a set of separate (high- and low-level) functions. Some interactive graphical user interface (GUI) functions are also available. NeuroAnalyzer functions can be combined into an analysis pipeline, i.e. a Julia script containing all steps of your analysis. This, combined with processing power of Julia language and easiness of distributing calculations across computing cluster, will make NeuroAnalyzer particularly useful for processing large amounts of neurophysiological data.  NeuroAnalyzer is a collaborative, non-commercial project, developed for researchers in psychiatry, neurology and neuroscience.  Every contribution (bug reports, fixes, new ideas, feature requests or additions, documentation improvements, etc.) to the project is highly welcomed.

Heesterbeek, K. Koolstra, M.J.P. van Osch, M.B. van Gijzen, F.M. Vos and M.A. Nagtegaal    Abstract:   Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) is  an imaging technique for simultaneous estimation of multiple quantitative parameters in a single acquisition. The efficiency of MRF results from strong k-space undersampling, but this can go at the expense of strong aliasing artifacts. The errors due to undersampling can be predicted based on a mathematical model leveraging on perturbation  theory. We exploited this model to perform MRF sequence optimization by adjusting the MRF flip angle train. Numerical simulations showed that the undersampling errors can be suppressed by sequence optimization. This was further corroborated in eight in vivo scans. The results were compared to sequences with a conventionally shaped flip angle pattern and an optimized pattern based on the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRB). A sequence optimized for improved  robustness against undersampling with a flip angle train of length 400 yielded significantly lower median absolute errors T1 (5.6%±2.9%) and T2 (7.9%±2.3%) compared to the conventional (T1: 8.0% ± 1.9%, T2: 14.5% ± 2.6%) and CRB-based (T1: 21.6% ± 4.1%, T2: 31.4% ± 4.4%) sequences. The proposed optimization scheme can be adapted to different  scan settings, reference maps and optimization parameters in a straightforward manner.",,

It does so by making kernels written in C/C++, OpenCL, or CUDA accessible from Python, while taking care of the required synchronization between data kept in host memory and data kept in device memory.  This has a number of advantages. First, it simplifies _auto-tuning_ of the kernel parameters. In fact, Kernel Tuner comes standard with a variety of strategies for efficiently searching the parameter space, leading to  greatly improved performance of tuned kernels. Second, it allows for unit testing of GPU code from within Python.   Kernel Tuner does not add any additional dependencies to the kernel code, and does not require extensive code changes. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that kernels tuned by Kernel Tuner do not require any changes after tuning to make them production ready--tuned kernels can be used as-is from any host programming language.",https://github.com/KernelTuner/kernel_tuner,KernelTuner/kernel_tuner

APE relies on a semantic domain model that includes tool and type taxonomies as controlled vocabularies for the description of computational tools, and functional tool annotations (inputs, outputs, operations performed) using terms from these taxonomies. APE then computes possible workflows based on this domain model and a specification of the available workflow inputs, the intended workflow outputs and possibly additional constraints.   Internally, APE uses a component-based program synthesis approach. It translates the domain knowledge and workflow specification into logical formulas that are then fed to a SAT solver to compute satisfying instances. These solutions are then translated into the actual candidate workflows. For a detailed description, we refer to [[1]](#1).  This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzecqRJXmoM) explains APE in 5 minutes.",https://github.com/sanctuuary/ape,sanctuuary/ape

Deep learning is a powerful tool to help with automated classification or regression tasks. However, designing a deep learning network that works well for your data is not trivial: it requires the user to choose the number of layers in the network, the number of nodes in each layer, the type of each layer, and so forth. With so many degrees of freedom, finding the network that is right for your data is an arduous task. Moreover, each network still needs to be calibrated or _trained_ before it can be usefully applied to automated classification or regression tasks.   mcfly simplifies this process by making explicit the required steps while offering useful default values at each step. mcfly then proceeds by trying out many different network configurations, training each one to the data provided by the user. It subsequently lists the performance of each network, along with a visualization that helps the user judge each network's tendency to overfit or underfit the data.",https://github.com/NLeSC/mcfly,NLeSC/mcfly

However, SWMM is not capable of accurately simulating the air behaviour in the pipe-filling phase, missing, therefore, a relevant factor during pipe pressurization. This work proposes the integration of a conventional accumulator model in the existing SWMM hydraulic model to overcome this gap. SWMM source code was modified to calculate the air piezometric head inside the pipe based on the system boundary conditions, and the air piezometric head was incorporated in the SWMM flow rate pressure component. Experimental data were collected during the rapid filling of a pipe system for three possible configurations that are likely to occur in intermittent water supply pipe systems: no air release, small air release, and large air release. Results show that the improved SWMM better describes the effect of the air behaviour using the extended transport (EXTRAN) surcharge method when compared to the original SWMM. Results also show that the SLOT method with a predefined slot width is not suitable for this purpose; thus, further research is needed to assess if an adjusted slot width could provide better results",https://data.4tu.nl/v3/datasets/a27fb47a-4bdd-419e-b93e-d4320c9b924a.git,

Diarrheal disease is the number two killer of children across the globe. Unchecked, climate change and its impacts on our planet will likely reverse hard-won gains in battling diarrheal diseases. Policy makers need to understand how diarrheal disease burden will change and how we can better protect children in a climate-uncertain future. We propose using artificial intelligence to mine existing literature to describe how climate might change diarrheal diseases in the future. We then will use this knowledge to project the risk of diarrheal disease into the future, preparing communities and informing policy makers.

The original module focused on understanding the economic viability of stockbreeding of cattle, sheep and horses for the Roman army. In particular slaughter rate proved to be an important parameter for this.  The standard input values used in the submodule are taken from the ROMFARMS source code, and are described and substantiated in Joyce (2019). However, users are free to adapt these values to their own research questions. The original module was developed for a runtime of 100 ticks (years), during which the herd size growth will be relatively modest using these parameters. However, after approx. 400 ticks the herd population will start to grow exponentially.          ## Inputs  |**Name**|**Type**|**Description**| |-|-|-| |species-type|string|animal species, OPTIONAL; for multiple species different rules can be specified if desired| |alphaA|floating point|age of senescence of animal| |alpha|floating point|standard deviation age of senescence| |NMR|floating point|mortality rate of neonatal animals| |BMR|floating point|background natural annual mortality rate of animals| |FR|floating point|fertility rate of female animals| |YAA|floating point|maximum age of young animal| |AAA|floating point|minimum age of adult animal| |YMR|floating point|mortality rate of young animal for slaughter| |IMR|floating point|mortality rate of immature animal for slaughter| |AMR|floating point|mortality rate of adult animal for slaughter| |animals|turtle-set|animals found in livestock herd| |sex (agent attribute)|string|sex of animal (F/M)| |age (agent attribute)|integer|age of animal| |fertility (agent attribute)|floating point|fertility of animal| |lactating (agent attribute)|string|lactation state of animal (Y/N)| |survivorship (agent attribute)|floating point|| ||||  ## Outputs  |**Name**|**Type**|**Description**| |-|-|-| |pop-list|integer|number of animals| |d-pop|integer|number of animals at end of year| |d1-pop|integer|number of animals at start of year| |livestock|turtle-set|current turtle set of animals| |pop-growth|floating point|herd population growth as the percentage increase or decrease from the previous year| ||||",https://github.com/Archaeology-ABM/NASSA-modules/tree/main/2025-Verhagen-001,
